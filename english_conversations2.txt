Did you clean your room today? No, not yet.
When were you planning on doing that? I'm going to clean it up later.
Didn't I ask you to clean it up earlier? I'm going to clean it.
I want you to vacuum in your room, and don't forget to dust everything. I know. I'll do it.
Make sure you clean it up before you do anything else. I'm not going anywhere until later, so I'll clean it then.
Have you begun cleaning up that room of yours? I haven't started yet, but I will.
What time are you going to clean it up? I'm planning on cleaning it up a little later.
I told you to clean it up earlier. I know. I am still going to clean it up.
Make sure you vacuum and dust your room. I won't forget.
I don't want you to leave until you clean up. My plans aren't until later, so I'll clean it before I go.
Have you started cleaning up your room yet? I haven't gotten started on my room yet.
When exactly do you plan on cleaning it? I have every intention of cleaning my room later.
I thought I asked you to clean your room earlier. I already told you that I'm going to do it.
Remember to vacuum the floor and dust everything. I'll remember to do that.
Make sure that you don't go anywhere until you clean your room. I'll clean my room before I leave.
I was wondering if you allow pets in this building. We do allow some pets, but you must pay an additional five hundred dollar security deposit.
What kind of pets do you allow? You may keep either one cat or one dog.
Can cats and dogs be outside? Cats can be outside, but we want them collared or tagged so we know who they belong to. Dogs must be on a leash and are not allowed in the flowerbeds.
Are there any special places nearby that I can walk my dog? There is a dog park down the block.
Do many other tenants in this building have pets? Not too many, but you shouldn't have any trouble finding someone to share walks with.
What is your policy towards tenants keeping pets? You may have a pet, but you have to pay an extra two hundred dollar cleaning deposit.
How many pets can we have? You may have only one pet. You can have either a small dog or a cat.
What is the policy as to where the pets can be outside? We ask that you keep your cats indoors or on your balcony. Dogs need to be walked to the street or park.
Where can I walk my dog? There is a park down the street, but you must keep your dog on a leash.
How many other people have pets around here? We have quite a few pet owners here, so if you need help finding a veterinarian, just ask around.
Are renters allowed to have pets? We allow a small well-behaved pet, but you need to sign an agreement saying you'll pay for any damages.
Do you allow both cats and dogs? We only allow a medium or small dog or a cat.
Are there any special areas where animals are allowed or not allowed? Cats are to be kept indoors at all times. Dogs must be on a leash and with the owner when outdoors.
Are there places where I can take my dog for a run? There are quite a few hiking trails nearby.
Are there a lot of pets in this building? We don't have a lot of pet owners, but there are a few around if you have any questions about local pet supplies and dog parks.
Mr. Lee, I was wondering if you and your wife had plans for next Friday night? Yes, I think we might be free. What did you have in mind?
I've mailed a formal written invitation to your home inviting you to a dinner party at my home. That sounds great. Is it casual?
Actually, we thought it would be fun to have a formal sit-down dinner for the holidays. That sounds good. It will give my wife a chance to dress up.
Yes, we've invited four other couples, so it should be a good mix of people. That sounds wonderful. Will there be anyone there that I know?
Oh yes, everyone we are inviting is from our company. Great! I'll look forward to it. We'll make sure and check the mail for our invitation.
Mr. Lee, would you and your wife be free next Friday night? I don't think we have any plans, but I would need to see what my wife has planned. Why?
My wife mailed a written invitation to your wife asking you both to our dinner party. It would be our pleasure to join you for dinner. What type of party is it?
We've always wanted to have a formal dinner party. I think we would enjoy that, especially our wives!
Four other couples are coming, so I'm hoping for some interesting conversation. I am sure we will have a great time. Will some of the couples be from our company?
Yes, you will know all of our guests. I'll make sure to check the mail for our invitation. Your dinner plans sound wonderful.
Would you and your wife be available next Friday night, Mr. Lee? I'll have to check with my wife, of course. Did you have something planned?
We are having a dinner party, and my wife sent you and your wife an invitation. I think we would enjoy that. Is it a formal affair?
My wife insisted on having it be a formal dinner party this time. That would be a change. Usually we just do barbeques and never get a chance to dress up.
We thought that inviting four other couples would make nice conversation. I think we will enjoy being there. Will we know anyone?
We are only inviting people from work. I am sure that a good time will be had by everyone. We will be looking for your invitation.
Is there someone I can talk to about a payment question? Yes, we can handle that here. How can I help you?
My paycheck that just arrived is less than last week's check. Did you work at all during the last pay period?
Yes, actually, I did make a little bit of money. Did you report it on your Continued Claim Form? 
Yes, I showed that income on the Continued Claim Form. Well, we deducted a portion of the income that you made from this week's check.
Maybe I just shouldn't show the income then. That is cheating and, if you get caught, you will be fined and disqualified from collecting unemployment.
I have a question about my payment and need someone to help me. Yes, I would be happy to answer a question about payment. What do you need help with?
I can't figure out why my paycheck this week is smaller than last week's. Did you generate any income during that time period?
I made a little bit of money, but not much. Did that income show up on your last Continued Claim Form?
I claimed the work I did on the last Continued Claim Form. When you are able to find work and get paid, we always take away part of your check.
That being the case, I don't think that I am going to show the income next time. Don't do it! If you get caught making false statements, you can have your claim closed.
I was wondering if someone in your office could help me with a question I have about my payment. I would be happy to answer any questions you might have.
My paycheck seems to be smaller than the one I received last week. What about income? Did you make any money during that period?
My old employer gave us a couple days of work during that period. When you filled out your Continued Claim Form, did you show that income?
Of course I wrote down the work that I had done on the Continued Claim Form. What happens is, when you make money, we take part of your benefits away.
I am not going to show any income from now on then. I wouldn't do that if I were you. There is a severe penalty if you get caught making false statements.
I'd like to reserve a hotel room. That should be no problem. May I have your full name, please?

Of course. I'm John Sandals. Hi, sir. My name is Michelle. Could you tell me when you need the room?
Right now. I plan to be there in April from the 14th to the 17th.  Perhaps you didn't know that we have new room rates. Do you find that acceptable, sir?
Maybe. How much is a room? The price per night is $308.
That sounds fine to me. Fantastic! Would you like a smoking or nonsmoking room?
I hate cigarettes! Nonsmoking. That'll be nonsmoking. Now, do you approve of a single queen-size bed?
That'll be no problem. I'm happy to hear that, sir. Your reservation is all set except for your phone number.
Sure! My number is 626-555-1739. 626-555-1739. Thank you for doing business with us, Mr. Sandals.
I need a hotel room. That's no problem at all. May I have your name, please?
Certainly. My name is John Sandals. It's a pleasure, Mr. Sandals. My name is Michelle. What days will you need a room?
Friday afternoon, April 14 through Monday morning, April 17. One minor problem, sir. Our prices are now slightly higher. Is that acceptable, sir?
Please tell me the price, so I can make a decision. It'll be $308 nightly.
That's a reasonable price. Good! Now, sir, do you have a preference for smoking or nonsmoking?
I quit smoking, so nonsmoking. I hear you, sir. Nonsmoking. Now, about the bed, is a queen-size okay?
A queen sounds great. Okay, sir, let me reserve those dates, there. Now, if you'll just tell me your phone number.
That would be 626-555-1739. That's 626-555-1739. Thank you so much for choosing our hotel, sir!
I need a room for a few days. That won't be a problem. Could you please tell me your name?
John Sandals. That's S A N D A L S. Sir, I'm Michelle, and I run the front desk. Please tell me the days you'll be here.
I'll be there in April: Friday through Monday, the 14th through the 17th. We recently changed many things here, sir, including our prices. Do you mind, sir?
Possibly. What's the actual price? The price will be $308 a night.
$308! That's not bad. Very good. Now, Mr. Sandals, about the room, smoking or nonsmoking?
Nonsmoking, definitely!  Most of our clients prefer nonsmoking. Now, does a queen sound okay?
Yes, that'll be just fine. One more second, sir. Your reservation is now verified, so all I need is your phone number.
It's 626-555-1739. Let me repeat that: 626-555-1739. Okay, sir, we look forward to seeing you in April!
Can I reserve a hotel room?  I assure you, that's not a problem. What is your full name, please? 
My name's John Sandals. It's a pleasure to assist you. Please tell me when you'll be needing the room, sir.
If my plans don't change, I'll need a room April 14 till April 17. Sir, our room prices are slightly higher than you may have thought. Will that be okay?
Tell me how much it will be, and I can tell you if it's okay. Only $308 per night, before taxes, of course.
$308 a night? That's a fair price. Now, as for the room, sir, do you prefer smoking or nonsmoking?
Nonsmoking, please. Nonsmoking. Now, sir, does a single queen-size bed meet your approval?
I have absolutely no problem with that. Queen, nonsmoking. Okay, sir, your room is reserved. Now if you'll just give me your phone number. 
Not a problem. The number is 626-555-1739.  Thank you for making a reservation with us. We look forward to seeing you in April!
May I speak with the property manager, please? Hello, this is the property manager. How may I help you?
During that horrible rainstorm last night, my roof began to leak. What room was the leak in?
It was in our bedroom. Are you on the top floor, or is there another apartment above you?
We are on the top floor. I will be sending someone out as soon as I can get hold of the roofer. Will you be home this morning?
Yes, we will be in all morning. Fine. If you do end up going somewhere, we can just use our pass key.
Good morning. I need to speak with the property manager, please. Good morning. You are speaking to the property manager.
While it was raining last night, water started leaking in from the ceiling. Was it leaking in the bedroom?
It was in the living room. Can you tell me which floor you are on?
We are on the bottom floor. I would like to look at the leak. Will you be home this morning?
Yes, someone will be here to let you in. Just in case you have to leave, we will just use the master key.
I need to talk with the property manager right away! This is the property manager. What seems to be the problem?
This morning, when we woke up, there was water pouring in from the ceiling! Could you tell me what room had the leak?
There were several rooms, but the worst leak was in the bathroom. Could you please remind me which floor you are on?
We are on the second floor, one of the middle floors. I will be sending the assistant manager to check it out. May we look at it this morning?
Actually, I have to go to school right now. If you aren't there, we will use our master key to get in and check things out.
Hi, I am your new neighbor and was wondering if I could ask you a question or two. Hi! I would be happy to answer any questions you might have.
Everyone here seems very friendly. Yes, many of us have lived here a long time and know each other well.
How long have you lived here? I have lived in this building for ten years.
When I get settled, would you consider giving me a list of places you use, like cleaners and grocery stores? I can help you with that. Would you like to go to the local farmer's market with me this morning?
That would be great! Fine. I'll knock on your door around ten o'clock then.
Hi, I am your new neighbor and would like to ask you about a few things. Hi, nice to meet you. Sure, ask me anything you need to know.
So far, everyone that I've met seems so helpful. We all seem to get along pretty well.
Have you lived here a very long time? I first moved here ten years ago.
I am having trouble figuring out the best places to shop and such. I am a pretty good source for all of that information. You could go to the local farmer's market with me today if you wish.
I would love to go with you! I'll be leaving around ten o'clock. I'll pick you up.
Hi, I just moved in next door and have a few questions. Hello, and welcome to our building. I would be happy to help you with your questions.
You all seem like a very pleasant group of tenants. We all try and help each other out when we can.
When did you first move here? I have lived here for quite awhile. Ten years!
I am not from around here, and I don't know where basic services are. I could help you find everything you need. Would you be interested in going to the local farmer's market with me?
What a great opportunity to get oriented to the neighborhood! It starts around ten. Just meet me in the parking lot around 9:45, and I'll take you there.
I am unsure how to add a class and need help. I have an opening. Do you have an add sheet for me to sign?
Yes, I have an add sheet. After I sign it, you must take it to the Admissions and Records Office to add the class. Do you know where that is?
No, I'm not sure. When you cross the quad, the office is right in front of you. Go inside and follow the signs to the correct line.
Thanks. I understand what to do now. It should be easy to find. After you add the class, check with me in a few weeks to make sure that you are on my roll sheet.
That sounds good. Good, just make sure that you do the same thing if you ever need to drop a class. Good luck!
Professor, can you help me add your class? You have to bring me an add sheet to sign. Do you have one?
No, I will have to get an add sheet. You must take the signed add slip to the Admissions and Records Office to add the class. Do you know where that is?
No, I don't know where that is. The office is in front of you as you cross the quad. The signs in the hallway will tell you where you need to be.
I think I can find it. You'll find it easily. Make sure you add the class and then we will look at the roll sheet later to make sure that you were added on.
Thank you for letting me add your class. To drop a class, you need to do the same thing with a drop slip. Good luck!
I am not sure how to add a class. Do you have an add sheet for me to sign? 
I'll bring one next time. When you get the signed add slip, you must take it to the Admissions and Records Office or you will not be added. Can you find the office?
I think I know where it is. Across the courtyard on the right is the office. Follow the signs to the correct line. Is that clear?
Thank you for your directions. It's clear. You can't miss it. Add the class and then come back. We'll check later to make sure you are on the roll sheet.
That's great. Thank you so much. Do the same thing with a drop slip if you ever need to drop a class. Good luck!
Is there anything I can help? Yes, thank you. I am really far behind on this project. Could you help me with the extra typing or xeroxing?
I can do either one. Good. That would be very helpful. Can you start with those pages over there?
No problem. Thank you very much! How long have you been working here?
I have been working here for 5 years. Well, we have some special projects coming up. Would you be interested in working on any of those?
Yes, I would love to work on a special project! Well then, I'll keep you in the loop. Thank you for your help today.
Do you need any help? I need some help catching up. Are you good at typing or could you help me xerox?
I like xeroxing. Thank you! There are papers on the table to start with.
That would be OK. I really appreciate the help. How many years have you been with the company?
I just started working here. I have a special assignment coming up. Would you be interested in helping me on it?
I'd like to, but I am very busy. I'll make sure that management keeps you in mind for special projects in the future. Thanks for the help!
What can I do to help you? I have some extra help with my project. What would you prefer to help me with, typing or xeroxing?
I could do some typing for you. That is very kind of you to offer to do that. Can you start with the pages on the table?
That would be a good place to start. I like your positive attitude. How many years have you been employed here?
I have worked here long time. We have a really interesting project coming up. Would you want to join us on it?
I'm not sure. Let me think about it. OK. I will mention how great you were about helping me today. I appreciate your help.
Excuse me, Professor. I have to talk to you about why my homework didn't get done. What happened that you didn't get it done?
I had to watch a football game instead. Well, you had more than one day couldn't you have fit it in on another day?
Yes, I think so. Either way, I only allow one missed assignment per semester. When will you be turning the make-up in?
I'll make it up next week. Fine, but it cannot happen again if you want an "A" in the class.
OK, I can do that. Remember that you are in college now, not high school.
I don't have my homework today. You usually are good about turning it in what happened?
I was really sick. But couldn't you have done it when you felt better?
Yes, I probably could. You have already missed one other assignment when can I expect the make-ups?
Next class meeting. That will be soon enough, but make sure you get next week's assignment in as well, all right?
That would work for me. Good. I know that you are capable of being an excellent student.
Let me tell you what happened to my homework. OK, go ahead--what is the excuse THIS time?
Actually, I did it, but then it got lost. Could you have gotten it done at another time?
Yes, I could. You have never missed an assignment before--when will you be making this one up?
I'll make it up early next week. That would work, but don't let it happen again.
I'll try. That will solve it then. Let's work hard to not let it happen again.
I was wondering if I could get my test results from the other day. Yes, I would like to schedule an appointment for you to come in and talk with me.
Is something wrong with me? No, sometimes the test results aren't clear and we need to do more to get a clearer picture.
Can we talk about it now? I would if I knew anything for sure, but I want to take a second look.
When can I come and see you? You can come in this afternoon. If you would feel better, bring your husband with you.
Now I know that something bad is up! Just relax. We will talk about it this afternoon.
The nurse said that you might have my test results in from the other day. I would like for you to come in and talk about a few more tests that I would like to run.
Does this mean that you have bad news for me? I just want to talk to you about the tests that I want to run.
Can't you just tell me now? I don't know anything for certain. We always do a double check if there is a question.
I want to see you right away. You can come in this afternoon. If you are feeling too stressed, feel free to bring a friend along.
I know for sure that something is wrong! Don't worry about a thing we are just taking a second look and talking.
The lab said that you would be getting my test results in today. I want you to come in and discuss some further tests that I would like to run.
I think that this is a bad sign. For now, I would like to run a few more tests to look into some of the problems that you mentioned.
Why wouldn't you tell me over the phone? If there is any question about test results, we always do a recheck.
I need to come in right away. I would be happy to see you this afternoon. If you are feeling upset, please bring a friend or relative along.
You are scaring me! Come on in this afternoon and we will talk. It will be fine!
I'm calling today about a bill that I never received. Can you tell me which credit card it was for?
It was for my Master Card. You should've gotten that bill two weeks ago.
I haven't got it in the mail yet. The computer is showing that all bills have been mailed.
What am I supposed to do about my bill then? Maybe you should call your post office.
But if it's their mistake, can I get an extension on my bill payment? Yes, but you will need to send us proof of their mistake.
Thank you very much for your help. No problem. Enjoy the rest of your day.
I haven't received my credit card bill yet. Which credit card are you speaking of?
My Master Card. We sent that bill out a couple of weeks ago.
I never got it. Your bill was mailed already.
What am I going to do since I haven't received the bill? If you haven't gotten it yet, then you should probably take that up with your post office.
Can I get an extension on my bill if it does happen to be the post office's fault? If that's the case, you will need to provide proof of their mistake.
Thanks for everything. Don't mention it. Call back if you have any more problems.
I was inquiring about a bill that I never got. Which credit card was the bill for?
The bill was for my Master Card. That bill should have been mailed about two weeks ago.
It never came in the mail. My computer shows that it has already been mailed.
I have not gotten my bill, so what should I do about that? You should try contacting your post office.
If it is the post office's fault, may I have an extension on my bill? You'll have to prove it was their error then you can get an extension.
Thank you for all your help. You are very welcome. Have a good day.
I am interested in buying a house and need some information. Yes, of course. What area are you interested in?
I am interested in Pasadena or Arcadia. What size house would you like?
We need a medium-sized house with at least 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. Are you interested in being in a particular school district?
Yes, we want to stay in the ABC School District. Would you like a home near the lake or would you prefer a view?
I would love to have a home with a view. Fine, I will begin a search for the perfect home for you. I will call you in a few days.
I would like to discuss purchasing a home with you. I can help you. What location are you looking for?
I would like to live in Pasadena or Arcadia. Have you thought about what your needs are in terms of size?
We would like a smaller cozy cottage with 2 bedrooms and 1 bathroom. Is living in a particular school district important to you?
No, we don't really care because they are all pretty good around here. Are you interested in purchasing on the lake, or would you like a home with a view?
We really want to live in a lakeside home with a dock for our boat. Now that I have an idea of what you want, I can begin my search.
I have been thinking of buying a house and would like to speak with you. I have time to speak with you. Where would you like to purchase your house?
I am most interested in Pasadena or Arcadia, but would be open to other suggestions. How many bedrooms and bathrooms do you need?
We have several generations of family living in our household and so need a very large home. Do you need to be located in a particular school district?
It doesn't matter, as we do not have any children. Is a view important to you, or would you rather be located on a lakeshore lot?
In a perfect world, we would like a home with a view of the lake. Thank you for all of the information. I will help you find the perfect house for you.
What are you doing this weekend? I'm going to the movies with a friend. How about you?
I'm not sure yet. Well, did you want to go see a movie with me?
What movie are you going to see? I'm not sure yet. Is there something you want to see?
There's nothing I can think of. So, did you want to go?
No, thanks, maybe another time. Okay, sounds good.
Do you know what you're going to do this weekend? I am going to see a movie with a friend of mine. What about you?
I don't know. Would you like to see a movie with me and my friend?
Do you know what movie you're going to watch? I don't know, but was there a certain movie you wanted to see?
None that I can think of. Well, would you like to go?
Thank you for inviting me, but I think I'll pass. All right. Another time then.
You have any ideas as to what you want to do this weekend? I'm going to the movie theater with my friend. What are you going to do?
I'm not quite sure yet. How about you see a movie with me and my friend?
What movie are you and your friend planning on watching? Not sure. Is there a movie out that catches your eye?
No good movies come to mind. Have you decided whether or not you would like to go?
No, thanks. Maybe another time. For sure another day.
Could I speak with the manager about some problems in the pool area? Sure, what seems to be the problem?
My apartment is next to the pool, and there seems to be some really late-night partying going on out there. The hours for the pool are eight in the morning to ten at night. Is the noise that you are hearing later than that?
Yes, sometimes people are in the Jacuzzi at midnight! Did you call the night manager?
No, I didn't really know if anyone was around that late. I am going to give you my number to call if it happens again.
Thank you for your help. You are welcome. I will be sending letters to tenants to remind them of the rules.
I had some concerns about the pool and Jacuzzi area and would like to speak with someone. I can help you with that. What are you having problems with?
I live right next to the pool, and late at night it is really noisy out there! There is not supposed to be anyone in the pool area after ten o'clock at night. Are you noticing people out there any later?
I've heard people out there at one in the morning! Did you contact anyone?
No, I just waited until now to tell you. I will give you the direct line to call to report this when it is happening
I appreciate your help. You are welcome. Evidently a few people need some reminders.
I was wondering if I could speak to someone about some concerns of mine with the pool area. I can answer any questions that you might have. What are your concerns?
I enjoy living next to the pool, but it gets really loud out there at night. The pool is supposed to be closed after 10:00. Are you saying that people are partying later than that?
There have been parties out there that haven't ended until two in the morning! Did you call the front desk?
Yes, I tried, but no one picked up. You can have my personal line to call if this happens again. Do not hesitate to call.
Thank you for taking care of this for me. Thank you for bringing it to my attention. We will send reminder memos to help people remember what the rules are.
How do I buy my textbooks? Do you have your book list for your class?
Yes, I have my list. Fine. Once you have it, you can go to the bookstore. Do you know where that is?
Yes, I know where the bookstore is. OK, so once you pass the gym, it's the first door on your left. Do you know you can also sell your used textbooks there? 
No, I didn't know I could do that. You just take them with you and trade them with the used textbook man just outside the door. Do you think you will be doing that today?
Yes, I am going today. Well, if you decide to go, I could meet you over there at 1:00 today or tomorrow to help you. Would that work for you?
Yes, thank you. That would be great. Well, then, I'll talk to you later. Have a good day!
Where can I buy textbooks? First, you need to have the list of books for your class. Do you have that?
Yes, I have that. Well, when you have that, you can take it over to the bookstore. Can you find it?
No, I don't know where the bookstore is. Just pass the gym and it's the first door on your left. Were you aware that you can also turn in your old textbooks for money?
Really? How can I do that? Take your used textbooks with you and give them to the representative near the entrance. He will pay you for them. Are you going today?
No, I can't make it today. I could help you with buying your books if you meet me there at 1:00 today or tomorrow. Would you like my help?
No, thanks. I'm good. I'll see you later then. Have a great day!
Can you help me buy my textbooks? There will probably be a book list in the bookstore. Do you have your class schedule handy?
No, I don't have that. To get started, take that list over to the bookstore. Do you know where the bookstore is?
I am not sure where the bookstore is. When you pass the gym, it'll be the first door on the left. Do you know how to sell your old textbooks for money?
Yes, I knew I could do that. Exactly how do I go about selling them? If you give your used textbooks to the person at the booth outside the door, he will reimburse you. Can you go over there today?
I think maybe I could be there. I am free at 1:00 today or tomorrow if you need some help. Want to meet me over there?
Maybe that would work. I'll catch you later then. Have a wonderful morning.
I would love to rent out your apartment. That's great.
How much is the rent? The rent each month is $1050.
That's a lot of money. Did you have a better price in mind?
What about $800? That's way too low.
I can't pay much more than that. How about $900 a month?
That would be fine. Great. It was a pleasure doing business with you.
I think I may rent this apartment from you. That would be wonderful.
Can you tell me how much I would have to pay for rent? The rent is $1050 every month.
That's way too much. What is good for you?
I can afford about $800 a month for rent. That's not high enough.
How much more are you thinking? I can let it go at $900 a month.
That's almost perfect. I can live with that too.
I want to rent this apartment. I'm glad to hear that.
How much are you asking? You will have to pay $1050 every month.
I can't afford that. What can you afford?
I was thinking $800 a month. I'll need you to pay more than that.
How much more? How does $900 every month sound to you?
I can live with that. We have a deal then.
It's such a nice day. Yes, it is.
It looks like it may rain soon. Yes, and I hope that it does.
Why is that? I really love how rain clears the air.
Me too. It always smells so fresh after it rains. Yes, but I love the night air after it rains.
Really? Why is it? Because you can see the stars perfectly.
I really hope it rains today. Yeah, me too.
Isn't it a nice day? It really is.
It seems that it may rain today. Hopefully it will.
How come? I like how clear the sky gets after it rains.
I feel the same way. It smells so good after it rains. I especially love the night air when it rains.

I really want it to rain today. Yeah, so do I.
Don't you think it's nice out? Yes, I think so too.
I think that it's going to rain. I hope that it does rain.
You like the rain? The sky looks so clean after it rains. I love it.
I understand. Rain does make it smell cleaner. I love most how it is at night after it rains.
How come? You can see the stars so much more clearly after it rains.
I would love for it to rain today. I would too.
Do you want to go to the beach tonight? Sure, which beach are we going to?
I wanted to go to Malibu beach. I like Santa Monica.
The water there looks so dirty. I just like the pier they have at Santa Monica.
I like the pier too, because it's beautiful at night. Is Malibu beach nice?
It's a lot nicer, and I really like it better. So you want to go to Malibu?
If that's okay with you. Sure, let's go to Malibu.
What do you think about going to the beach tonight? I'd love to. Which beach?
It's up to you, but I was thinking Malibu beach. I really like Santa Monica beach.
But the water there doesn't look too clean. I only go because of the pier.
The pier is really nice at night. How is it at Malibu beach?
I love Malibu beach, because it's so beautiful. So is Malibu where you really want to go?
Are you cool with that? Yeah, we can go to Malibu.
I want to go to the beach tonight. That sounds like fun. Which one are you thinking about?
I was thinking Malibu, unless there is another beach you want to go to. How about Santa Monica?
I don't really like that beach, as the water seems really dirty. The only thing I like about that beach is the pier.
At night, the pier is absolutely beautiful. What's it like at Malibu beach?
I love that beach, because it's just so nice. So we're going to Malibu?
Well, if you don't want to go to Malibu, we can go to Santa Monica. We can always go to Santa Monica another day.

Yes, and I believe they messed up on my order also. That may be so, but I bet your sandwich was delicious.
What are you having for lunch? I got a sandwich, some chips, and a soda.
Did you bring that from home? I got it from the cafeteria.
What kind of sandwich did you get? They messed up my order and gave me a bologna sandwich.

I think I got a sandwich there once before. Really?

So, I can see by your chart that you are here for your annual physical. Yes, I am playing on the tennis team this year, and they are requiring me to get a physical exam.
We are basically going to check your heart, lungs, blood sugar levels, and eyes, ears, and nose. I've kind of been having problems being out of breath. Can you look at that?

I am not sure I even want to look at this house! It is a bit of a fixer-upper. Let's take a look inside.
It doesn't look much better inside this place. You know, with a little elbow grease and paint, you could spruce it up a bit.
There are hardly any windows in here, and that makes it really gloomy. Let's go check out the kitchen. The printout says that it is quite large.
Look at those broken tile countertops and the peeling wallpaper. Maybe the master suite has some redeeming qualities. Follow me, please.
What's that smell? Perhaps we should move on to the next listing.
This house is not looking all that great from here You can't really tell everything about a house from the outside. Let's go inside.
I don't think that it is looking any better inside here. I think that fresh paint and cleaning would help it look a little better.
It is just too dark in here with so few windows. I hear that the kitchen is quite large. Let's go check it out.
The kitchen may be large, but it doesn't have any storage space. The master suite is supposed to be quite elegant. Maybe it will be a little better.
How many dogs live in this house? I think that we have seen all that we need to see here. Let's go look at another house.
From the looks of this house from the outside, I don't really think that I want to go inside. From here, it does look like it could use a little work. Let's see what the interior looks like.
I am not impressed by the interior of this house. Sometimes all a place needs is a little bit of cleaning and some fresh paint.
With so few windows, how can you even see what the problems are? I think that we should check out the kitchen. It is listed as roomy and spacious.
Where are you supposed to store things without any cabinet space? The picture in the listing shows a lovely master suite. I think that we should go look at it since we are here.
Is there a dead animal somewhere in here? Well, I think that it is pretty safe to say that this is not the house for you.

Yes, I do. Let me see if I can find one of these classes on another day.

Thank you. I didn't want to have to take this to court. Sir, we never want a guest to stay here mad or unhappy.
This room is unacceptable. I want a new one, and I want a refund for tonight. Would you please tell me the exact problem, sir?
I'm being attacked by hordes of cockroaches! Oh, my gosh, they're back? Another room at once, sir, plus a full refund, of course.
Thank you very much. This has been a most unsettling experience. Sir, our guests are our reason for being.
This room is unfit for humans. I want another room, and I want a refund for tonight. Perhaps if you would be kind enough to tell me the problem, sir.
In a word, cockroaches! Oh, no, are they back? I'll give you another room immediately, sir, and a refund for tonight.
Thank you. I'm glad that you don't believe that your guests are liars. Sir, without happy guests, we are nothing.
I want to change rooms. In fact, I want a refund for tonight! If you tell me the exact problem, I can be more helpful.
Cockroaches have declared war on my room! Allow me to apologize. I'll give you another room right now, and a full refund for tonight.
Thank you for not asking me to collect the roaches in a jar as evidence. Sir, only your mother wants to please you more than we do.
Hello, Nicole? This is Jimmy in 309. Hello, Jimmy. What's up? 
You're not going to believe this. Believe me, I think I've heard everything.
I can't find my mailbox key. Is that all? That's a lot better than losing your car keys.
I had a duplicate, but I can't find it either. If you come by my place, I can loan you a key.
There's no emergency. All I get is junk mail and bills. Can you wait till Wednesday? I'll make you two more keys.
Sure, that'll be fine. Okay. I'll see you Wednesday. But it's going to cost you $2 per key.
Can I speak to Nicole? This is Jimmy in apartment 309. Hi, Jimmy. This is Nicole. What's happening?
You probably never heard this one before. Don't bet on it. I've been an apartment manager for a long time.
I've looked everywhere, but I can't find my mailbox key. Well, that's pretty minor. I lost my car keys and house keys once.
To make matters worse, I can't find my duplicate either. If you want, come over here and I'll lend you a key.
No, there's nothing vital in the mailbox. Just junk and bills. If you can wait until Wednesday, I'll make two more keys for you.
Wednesday's fine.  Okay, I'll bring them by Wednesday. Have $4 ready for me.
Hi, Nicole. This is Jimmy in 309. Hello, Jimmy. Can I help you?
I've got a little problem. Tell me your problem, and maybe I can help.
I've looked everywhere, but I can't find my mailbox key. Well, that's pretty minor. I lost my car keys and house keys once.
As if that wasn't bad enough, I also misplaced the duplicate. Well, if it's an emergency, come by here and I'll lend you a key.
No, even if there's a bill in there, it can wait. If you don't mind waiting until Wednesday, I'll make two more keys for you.
Oh, I can wait, believe me. Okay, see you Wednesday. They're not free, you know. It'll be $4.
Hey, Nicole. It's Jimmy in 309. Hi there, Jimmy. What can I do for you?
I screwed up, and I need your help. Tell me the specific problem. Let me see what I can do.
I've torn my apartment apart, but I can't find my mailbox key. Well, you should be grateful it wasn't your car keys.
On top of that, I couldn't find the duplicate either. If you need to get in there, come by and borrow a key.
No, my mailbox is usually empty anyway. Well, then, I'll make you two more keys on Wednesday.
No problem. I can wait till Wednesday. Maybe there'll be something in there by then. Okay. Have $4 ready for when you see me Wednesday.
Hello? This is Jimmy in 309. Hi, Jimmy. This is Nicole. What's going on?
Maybe you can get me out of a small jam. Well, I can certainly try.
Somehow, I managed to lose my mailbox key. Believe me, losing a mailbox key is a lot better than losing your car keys.
I've got a duplicate somewhere, but I haven't been able to find it either. If you absolutely can't wait, come over here and borrow a key.
No, I doubt that there's anything important in my mailbox, if there's anything at all. Well, if there's no emergency, I can make you two more keys on Wednesday.
Not a problem. All my fan mail can wait till then. Okay, see you Wednesday. Have $4 for me, and I'll give you a receipt.

I kind of want pizza. I ate pizza the other day.

We can just each get what we want to get. That sounds like a plan.

Do you know what you want to eat for lunch? What do you feel like having?
I want to get some pizza. I had pizza for lunch yesterday.

Their range of organic foods is very limited. Whole Foods has a lot of organic foods?
Yes, the food there is very healthy. I've never been, but I may start shopping there.
The food there is a great step up from Vons. Thanks for letting me know.
Have you ever done your shopping at Whole Foods market? I haven't shopped there. How is the food?
The food there is wonderful. I go to Vons for my groceries.
I prefer the food at Whole Foods. Is there something wrong with Vons?
Vons doesn't offer a lot of organic foods. Do they offer organic foods at Whole Foods?
Yes, that's the place to go to get healthier food. Maybe I'll try that store out.
If you like Vons, then I'm sure you'll love Whole Foods. You're making me a believer.
Have you ever been shopping at Whole Foods? No, I haven't. Is the food good there?
They have the freshest foods there. I usually shop at Vons.
I used to shop there, but I find the food at Whole Foods to be a lot better. What's the problem with Vons?
They don't have a lot of organic foods there. Is there a big selection of organic foods at Whole Foods?
They have lots of healthier food at Whole Foods. I haven't been shopping there, but maybe I'll try it sometime.
Whole Foods is way better than Vons, trust me. I'll take your word for it.

Did you feed the puppies today? Yes, I have.
That's good! Just make sure to bathe them later. No problem. I can do that for you.
Thank you! You know they have to go to the vet on Saturday? I know. What time do they go?
Their appointment is at eleven o'clock in the morning. Okay, I won't forget.
Have you given the puppies food yet? Of course. I fed them today.
Good job! Please give them a bath later on today. Sure, I'll give them a bath.
Thanks. But don't forget that they have a vet appointment this Saturday. I remember. What time do they need to be there?
They need to be there at eleven in the morning. All right. I'll make sure and remember.
Have you given the puppies anything to eat today? I fed them earlier today.
Great! Could you please bathe them later? Okay, I'll do that later.
Thank you! Remember that they go to the vet this Saturday. I know. What time is their appointment?
We need to have them there at 11:00 AM. I got it. I will remember.
Wake up, it's time for school. I'm so tired. Let me sleep for five more minutes.
You have to get up and get ready for school. I know, but just five more minutes.
I can't let you go back to sleep, because you won't wake back up. I promise I'll wake up, in five minutes.
You still need to eat breakfast, take a shower, and get dressed. I realize that, and I can do all that when I wake up in five minutes.
I don't want you to be late for school today. I'm not going to be late today.
Fine, five more minutes. Thank you.
Get up, it's time for you to get ready. Let me just get five more minutes of sleep.
I would, but you need to start getting ready for school. I understand, but all I want is five more minutes of sleep.
If I let you go back to sleep, I know that you won't get up in five minutes. Trust me. I'm going to wake up.
You have a lot to get done this morning. I already know, and I'll take care of all that when I wake up.
I want you to be on time for school today. I'll make it to school on time. Don't worry.
I'll let you sleep for a little while longer. I really appreciate that.
It's time for you to wake up. Give me five more minutes. I'm really tired this morning.
I'm sorry, but it's time for you to get ready for school. I get that, but let me just sleep for a little bit longer.
You're not going to get up in five minutes if I let you fall back asleep. Believe me. I will get up and get ready in five minutes.
There's a lot that you need to do this morning. I understand, and it will get done after I wake up in five minutes.
I would like for you to not be late for school. I'm going to be on time today.
Go back to sleep then, but only five more minutes. Thanks a lot.
Can you help me figure out how to use this machine? Yes, I would be happy to help. What do you want to buy?
I want to buy that candy. OK. So this machine will make change if you need it. Do you have your dollars ready?
Yeah, so far, so good. Next, you feed your dollars into the machine in the slot. Make sure they are smooth.
Yeah, I already knew that. I'm sure you know that if the dollar gets stuck, you might have to re-feed it.
OK, let's move on! Now you just make your selection and pray. If nothing comes out, try again or call the number on the side of the machine.
I hope it works! Well, good luck!
I've never seen a machine like this before and need some help. Sure, no problem. What are you trying to get?
I want to buy a drink. OK. This machine needs you to use that change machine first to get correct change. 
I've got the correct change already. First you put your money in the dollar slot or the coin slot. The dollars have to be smooth.
OK, what next? Just know that sometimes the money doesn't go in perfectly the first time and you have to try again.
OK, next?  Choose what you want and push the button. Sometimes it takes a couple of tries.
I agree with you. Hope that works for you!
I want to know how to buy something from this machine. Yeah, the new ones can be tricky. What are you trying to buy?
I want to buy one of those snack things. Are you ready to go?
I'm clear so far. The money goes in the slot over there. It has to be smooth to go in.
It won't go in! Just remember that you might have to feed the money in a couple of times to get it to work.
Yes, next step. Make your selection and hope for the best. Vending machines aren't all that reliable.
They're totally unreliable. You seem to have it down. Have a good day!
Did you go to school today? Yeah, I went to school today. Were you there?
No, I didn't go, I've been sick. That sucks. Did you want the assignments from English class?
That would be nice, thank you. No problem, you're welcome.
I will be glad to do the same for you when you're sick. Well, thank you. I hope to see you at school tomorrow.
Have you attended school today? I attended school today. Did you?
I wasn't able to attend school because I was feeling ill. I'm sorry to hear that. Would you like the assignments from English class?
I would really appreciate that, thanks. It's no trouble at all.
If you get sick, I'll return the favor. Thanks. See you at school tomorrow if you feel better.
Have you gone to school today? I went to school today. Did you go to school?
I couldn't go to school today, I was sick. That's horrible. I'd be happy to give you the assignments from English class.
Thank you very much, that's kind of you. Don't mention it.
When you miss a day of school, I'll be happy to give you the English assignments. That is greatly appreciated and I hope you feel well enough to go to school tomorrow.

I would like to order cable. Sure, what package do you want?
What kinds of packages do you offer? We have all kinds of movie channel packages.
What else do you have? There is a package for all sports channels.
Do you have a package that includes all the movie channels with the basic channels also? Yes, we do offer that package.
I want that. Do you want anything else?
No, but is it possible for me to add channels later? You can always get rid of channels or add some later.

So how did you like the restaurant? Actually, it could have been better.
What didn't you like about it? It is a new restaurant. I don't think they have their act together yet.
What did you think about the food? I felt that the food was pretty mediocre.
The service wasn't that great, either. I agree. The service was not good.
Do you think that you want to try this restaurant another time? No, I think that I've had enough of this restaurant.
Did you enjoy the restaurant? I didn't really like it all that much.
What do you think the problem was? Well, they are pretty new. I just didn't feel that they were ready to open yet.
How did you feel about the food? The food wasn't all that exciting.
I didn't think that the service was good, either. Yes, the service certainly didn't add to the experience.
Would you like to return to this restaurant? Maybe we could try it again in a few months when things have settled down.
How do you feel about that restaurant? It wasn't all that great.
What did you dislike the most? I don't think that they had their act together. They didn't seem well prepared.
Did you think that the food was any good? I wasn't all that impressed by the food.
The service certainly could have been better. The service did not help the situation.
Is this a restaurant that you want to come back to? I am not really interested in trying this restaurant again.
What's going on? Nothing really, you?
I'm throwing a party next Saturday. Is that right?
Yeah, are you going to come? I'm sorry, I can't.
Why not? I don't really want to.
Well, why don't you? I hate going to parties.
Well, that's okay. Yeah, sorry.
What's up? Nothing, how about you?
Next Saturday, I'm going to have a party. Oh, really?
You are coming? Probably not.
Why is that? I don't feel like going.
Why not? I really can't stand going to parties.
I understand, I guess. Sorry about that.
What's happening? Not a lot, what about you?
I'm having a party next Saturday. That's nice.
Are you going to be there? I don't think so.
Is there a reason why? I just really don't want to go.
How come? I don't really like parties.
I wish you would go, but that's okay. I'm sorry.
I need some flowers for my wife because it is her birthday. We have some fresh red roses.
How much are the roses? Twenty dollars per dozen.
That sounds like a good deal. Yes, that is today's sale price.
I'll take a dozen. Is there anything else you'd like to get?
No, the roses will be fine. I'm sure your wife will love them.
It's my wife's birthday, and I'm going to buy her some flowers. Perhaps you'd be interested in red roses.
How much do the roses cost? They're only $20 a dozen.
That sounds good, since last year I paid $30. Yes, you're saving money because they're on sale today.
I'll take a dozen of your most beautiful roses. Could I interest you in anything else?
No, I'll just give her the roses and a card. She should be very pleased with these roses.
I need to buy some flowers for my wife's birthday. Red roses are always a popular gift for birthdays.
What would the roses cost me? You can get a dozen for only $20.
That's a price that I like. You're in luck today because the roses are on sale.
I'll purchase the roses. Perhaps you'd like something else to go with the roses?
No, the roses are good enough. These roses should make your wife very happy.
Is there a swimming pool in this hotel? We don't have a full-sized swimming pool, but we do have individual swim stations.
What exactly does that mean? Basically, a swim station is like a treadmill, except instead of running, you swim.
That sounds really neat. Is there an extra charge for these swim stations? If you're a registered guest, you have free access to our swim stations.
Are the swim stations open 24 hours, like the rest of the gym? To conserve electricity, the stations operate only from 7:00 a.m. till 10:00 p.m. 
I'll go down there as soon as I can! I don't think you'll be disappointed. People really seem to like the swim stations.
Does this hotel have a pool? I'm sorry, sir, we don't have one. However, in our gym, we do have swim stations.
I'm not sure I understand. Think of a deep bathtub that you can swim in, but against a current.
Cool. What will they think of next? How much are they? Sir, guests pay nothing to use the stations.
Excellent! Now what are the hours? The gym is open 24/7, but the stations are open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. only.
I'm going to change into my trunks right now! I think you'll like the experience, sir. It's a great workout.
Do you have a swimming pool in this hotel? We don't have a pool, sir, but we do have swim stations in the gym.
I never heard of a swim station. Is that like a train or bus station? It's just a deep bathtub with a current of water that you swim against.
Holy cow! I never heard of such a thing. How much do they cost? As a guest, sir, you pay nothing.
This sounds better every second. Now, when can I use the stations? If you want to swim, you can visit the gym any day between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m.
Oh, boy! This is going to be great. I'm going to the gym right now! I'm sure you'll enjoy your workout, sir. Everyone seems to like the swim stations.
I think I've looked everywhere, but I haven't seen a swimming pool here. This hotel has no full-size pool, but we do have swim stations in our gym.
Swim stations? Whoever heard of such a thing? You swim in a swim station just like you run on a treadmill.
All that exercise in a little pool! Do I have to pay anything? The swim stations are available to all guests for no charge.
Very good. Now can you tell me the hours of operation? They're available anytime between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m., seven days a week.
Wow! I can't wait to change into my trunks! The swim stations are very popular, sir. I hope you don't find a line down there.
I've been looking for a swimming pool, but I haven't found one yet. We have no pool, sir, but we do have swim stations in our gym.
Swim stations? Could you be a little more explicit? You know how you run on a treadmill but don't go anywhere? Well, it's the same thing.
Gee, that's a great idea. Now, how much do I have to pay? The stations are absolutely free to guests, sir.
Great! Now, when can I go down there and use the stations? The swim stations are open daily from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.
Boy, oh boy! I can't wait to change into my swim trunks. Be warned, sir. At certain hours the swim stations are very crowded.
Tell me, what do you enjoy doing in your spare time? I enjoy drawing and painting.
You know how to draw and paint? Yes, I do.
When did you learn how to do that? I learned back in high school.
Oh, so you took an art class? Yeah, I loved that class.
I see that you're pretty talented. Thank you very much.
I wish I had a talent like that. I'm sure you have a talent. It's just hidden.
What kinds of things do you like to do? I've always liked to draw and paint.
I didn't know you knew how to draw and paint. I do it every once in a while.
How long have you known how to do that? I first learned how to do it in high school.
Did you take some sort of art class or something? That was my favorite class.
You have got to be talented. Thanks.
If only I was talented. You have a talent. You just don't know what it is yet.
Are there any hobbies you do? When I have time, I sometimes draw and paint.
Oh, you actually do that? Every so often, I do.
Did you always know how to draw and paint? I was taught in high school how to draw and paint.
You had an art class? Exactly, it was my favorite class.
Well, it's good that you're so talented. I appreciate that.
Talent is a great thing, I wish I had one. Everyone has a talent. They just need to find it.
The front desk told me to ask you for sightseeing advice. Of course. I'd be more than happy to help. I am, after all, the hotel's concierge.
Concierge? What exactly is that? We advise you on where to visit, eat, or shop during your stay here in New York.
Great! So where should I start my sightseeing? The Statue of Liberty is always a good place to begin.
I saw the Statue of Liberty on my last visit here. Can you recommend somewhere else? Hmm. What type of interests do you have?
In my spare time, I really like to view art and go running. Aha! Have you been to Central Park or the Museum of Modern Art?
No, but I've heard a lot about both. Well, Central Park is wonderful for running. Afterwards, you should head to the Museum to enjoy the art.
Great! That sounds like a plan. Thanks a lot. I'm sure you'll have a good time there.
I was told to see you about going sightseeing. It's my pleasure. I'm the hotel's concierge, at your service.
Concierge? Could you explain that to me? We help direct hotel visitors to popular places to visit, eat, and shop.
Very good. So where shall I begin my sightseeing? I would suggest the Statue of Liberty.
Gee, I've already seen the Statue of Liberty. What about another site? Let me see. What do you like to do in your spare time?
I really like to run. And I like art. Well, there you go! Have you ever visited either Central Park or the Museum of Modern Art?
No, but I've been meaning to. Well, Central Park is fantastic for running. Then you can go to the Museum to look at the beautiful art.
That sounds like a great plan. I'll do that. Enjoy your run and your visit!
I need some sightseeing advice. That's what I'm here for, sir. Every good hotel has a concierge like me.
I don't travel a lot. What exactly is a concierge? A concierge helps visitors like you find great places to visit, shop, and eat.
That's great! So tell me, where should I go first? I'd suggest that you start at the Statue of Liberty.
You know, I've already been there. Can you suggest another place? Maybe. Tell me what you like to do in your spare time.
When I have some free time, I often spend it running or at museums. Well, have you ever been to either Central Park or the Museum of Modern 
No, but I sure would like to. Central Park is great for just about everything outdoors. Then you can visit the Museum of Modern Art.
Both places sound great. I'll try to do that today. Enjoy the views at both places.
I'm going sightseeing, but I'd like to get your advice first. I'm only too happy to help. Tourists should always check with their concierge first.
Concierge? I'm not familiar with that word. A concierge directs visitors to the city's great tourist, shopping, and eating places.
That sounds great. Now, is there any place that I should hit first? Well, if you're like most people, you'll want to go to the Statue of Liberty.
I've already seen it, I loved it, but today I want to go somewhere else. Sure! Tell me about your interests.
I like to run and I like to see the works of the masters. You'll get along fabulously at Central Park and the Museum of Modern Art! Have you been to either?
No, I just haven't had the opportunity. You'll love Central Park for running. Later on, you can go to the Museum of Modern Art.
Thank you. That's what I'll do. This might be the best day of your visit.
I need some sightseeing advice. I was told to come to see you. As your concierge, it is my pleasure to help you, sir.
Concierge? Are we speaking English here? A concierge helps you find all the great places for visiting, shopping, and eating.
What would you suggest that I visit first? How about starting at the Statue of Liberty? Many people like to begin there.
The last time I was here, I visited the Statue. So do you have another place in mind? I think so. Tell me what interests you.
I'm big on running, although maybe I like art even more than running. Then you must go to Central Park and the Museum of Modern Art! Have you been to either one?
No. I haven't had a chance to go to either of them. Both places are usually crowded with natives and tourists. You'll love the Park and the Museum.
Thank you. That's great advice. This might be the best day of your visit.
Can you give me some advice about going sightseeing?  Your concierge, sir, is the right person to ask when you need sightseeing advice.
What in the world is a concierge? We direct visitors to all the great tourist, shopping, and eating spots in the city.
Then what would you recommend as a starting point for my sightseeing? Definitely the Statue of Liberty. I think that that is everyone's favorite first stop. 
Actually, I've already been there twice. Do you have another suggestion? I think I can come up with something. How do you spend your spare time?
I keep my body healthy by running and my mind active by visiting museums. Well, the Museum of Modern Art and Central Park were made for you! Have you gone to either one?
No, although I've heard great things about both of them. You don't want to miss either place. Central Park and the Museum of Modern 
Sounds great! I'll get my running gear and then I'm out of here. This is a day you're going to remember for a long time.
Do you want some dessert? No thanks. We just need our check. Have you seen the waitress?
Where is our waitress anyway? Yes, the service hasn't been the best. Is that our waitress over there?
I'll walk over and get the bill, since I don't think the waitress is coming over here any time soon. Good idea. Just bring it back and we'll figure it out together.
So the bill is $36.00. How much do you think we should leave for a tip?
My first inclination is to leave nothing for a tip. I agree, but we don't really know the whole story. There may have been problems in the kitchen beyond her control.
Let's leave 10%, so that we at least leave something for the service. I agree. We will leave $3.60 for the tip.
Would you like some more coffee? No thanks. I'm full. We need to find our waitress and get our bill.
Good luck finding the waitress! The service this evening has kind of sucked. Is that our server over there?
I'll go get the check, since our server doesn't seem to be headed this way. Good. I'll just stay here until you get back.
So the total is $36.00 for our dinner. How much of a tip do you think our waitress deserves?
I wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service. I kind of feel the same way, but they may have just been really short-staffed tonight.
I think that we should leave 10%. $3.60 will be the right amount for the tip.
Would you like to order anything else? No, I'm good. All we need now is our check.
Our waitress has been kind of scarce tonight, hasn't she? I think that is our waitress over by the bar. Boy, the service has not been good this evening.
She doesn't appear to be headed this way, so I will go get the check. Good. Just bring it back and we'll total it together.
Our total for dinner is $36.00. What do you think would be the right amount to tip?
I kind of don't want to leave any tip for the lousy service we received. I agree that it was bad service, but I heard one of the other waiters mentioning that it was our server's first night on the job.
I believe that 10% is just about right. I think that a tip of $3.60 will be the right amount to leave.
What does she look like? Well, she was pretty tall, about 5 feet 10 inches and kind of scary looking!
What do you mean, scary? Well, she had a crazy sounding laugh and wild hair. Do you know what I mean?
Yes, I know what you mean. And her piercing eyes! She looked like an alien who just came down from outer space. Do you believe that people from outer space live amongst us?
No, that's impossible! Unless they beam us up for a ride, we will never know for sure. Have you ever thought that you saw a flying saucer?
Are you crazy? Hah, I guess we never know what can happen. Do you like Star Wars movies?
Yes, I have seen all of the Star Wars movies. I loved Star Wars movies. My favorite character was Yoda. What about you?
I liked Darth Vader. Yeah, that character was pretty cool. If you had to describe that character, what would you say about them?
They were very beautiful. Yeah, I know what you mean!
Can you describe her for me? She was large, hairy, and scary!
What are you talking about? When she laughed, it sent chills up my spine. Have you ever met someone like that?
Yes, one time I met someone like that. She had eyes like laser beams. Sometimes I wonder if aliens from UFOs live here with us. Do you think that's possible?
Sure, I think it could happen. I guess it's impossible to say for sure unless you go for a ride in one. Do you think that would be an interesting experience?
No, I never want to be near a UFO! Well, you will probably never see one. Have you seen any Star Wars movies?
No, I haven't seen any Star Wars movies. Star Wars was the best. I really like Darth Vader. Do you have a favorite character?
I like Luke Skywalker. Oh yeah, I forgot about that character! What words do you think would best describe that character?
He looked like a black vacuum cleaner. I totally agree!
How does she look? I am not sure how tall she was but she was very scary!
Is this a joke? Oh my god, you should have seen her! She looked like she had just crawled out from underneath something. Do you get what I am saying?
No, I have no idea what you are talking about. Oh man, her eyes were the most incredible glowing green. She might be a Martian or something. Do you think that is possible?
Yes, I believe in UFOs. I've never seen a UFO but I would like to. How about you?
Yes, I think that seeing a UFO would be fascinating. Personally, I've never seen one. I think is would be fun to see the universe like in a Star Wars movie. Have you seen the Star Wars movies?
I saw some of them. I loved the special effects and the story. I like Princess Leah. Who did you like the best?
I like Yoda. Yes, that is a good choice. How would you describe that character if you had to tell someone what they looked like?
He was hot! That's a really good description.
I would like to exchange this dress. You can exchange this dress with anything of the same value.
Is there anything on sale today? I'm sorry. There are no sales today.
Are dresses going to be on sale? Everything's going to be on sale next weekend.
That's great. I'll wait. See you next weekend. Okay. I'll see you then.

What's going to be on sale? Dresses, skirts, blouses, pantsuits…everything will be on sale.
That sounds great. I'll come back next weekend. Okay. Don't forget to bring your credit card.
This dress doesn't fit correctly. No problem. Shop around until you find something you like.
What's on sale today? If you can wait until next weekend, you can save some money.

I was hoping you'd have something on sale today. We have nothing on sale today. But we're having a big sale next weekend.
Is the sale going to include dresses? Everything you can see will be on sale.
I like the sound of that. I'll just come back next weekend. The savings will be worth the short wait. See you next weekend.
I would like to make an appointment to discuss the problems I keep having with my apartment. Are you having problems? This is the first I've heard of it.
We gave you a list of problems last week. What kind of problems are you talking about?
The garbage disposal doesn't work, we have rats, and the toilet is backed up. Maybe I could get back to you in a few weeks. I am leaving on vacation this afternoon.
These things are your responsibility, and you need to fix them immediately. Don't tell me what to do! I'll get to it when I get around to it!
If these problems are not addressed immediately, I will be contacting the health department this Friday. I'll be right over!
We would like you to stop by again so we can show you some more problems that have come up with our apartment. I am kind of busy right now, but maybe later next week I could stop by.
We sent you an e-mail the first week we moved in it listed the problems we found. What problems did you find?
The roof leaks when it rains, there is mold on the bedroom walls, and the dishwasher doesn't work. I don't really consider any of that to be my responsibility. You can fix those things yourself.
Maintaining basic health and safety standards is your responsibility. I am maintaining the building. You are way too picky!
Unfortunately, you won't be getting a rent check unless these problems are fixed by Friday. You wouldn't dare do that!
You really need to look at some of the problems we are having with the apartment. That apartment never had any problems before. Are you sure the problem isn't you?
We spoke with you the first week we moved in about things that you promised to fix. Where do you think you have problems?
There is no hot water, the bedroom has a broken window, and there are rats in the kitchen. You know, no one else who has been in that apartment has had a problem before.
You are obligated to maintain your building and my apartment. I will fix these problems when I get around to it.
I will be withholding my rent check this Friday unless these problems are addressed immediately. You can't do that! It's illegal!
I would like to open an account today. What kind?
I want to open a checking account. You need to keep a minimum balance.
How much is it? You need at least $100 in your account.
Is that all? Yes. That's the minimum.
What happens if I don't meet that requirement? You will get a fine.
How much? It's going to be $25.
I need to open an account. Do you know what kind you want to open?
I want a checking account. Do you know what the minimum balance is?
What is that? You need to keep it at $100.
That's it? That's the least amount you can have.
What'll happen if I don't maintain that? We will fine you.
How much will I be fined? You will be fined $25.
I want to open an account. What kind of account do you want to open?
I want to open a checking account. Do you know the minimum balance you're required to keep?
How much is that? You have to maintain a minimum balance of $100.
Really? Yes, really.
What if I can't meet that requirement? You will be fined.
How much is the fine? It's going to cost you $25.
Can I start you off with anything to drink? Yes, may I have some water, please?
Sure, would you like any appetizers today? May I get an order of barbeque wings?
No problem, can I get you anything else? No, thank you, that'll be all for now.
Let me know when you're ready to order your food. I'm ready.
What can I get you? May I have the fettuccini Alfredo?
Will that be all? Yes, that's it.
May I get you anything to drink? Yes, please. May I get a glass of lemonade?
Would you like an appetizer? May I get an order of barbeque wings?
Sure, would you like anything else? That'll be fine for now, thank you.
Tell me when you want to order the rest of your food. Excuse me. I'm ready to order.
What would you like? Let me have the baby-back ribs.
Sure, will there be anything else that I can get you? That will be it for now.
Good evening, can I get you a drink? Sure, I would like a Coke.
Would you like to order anything off the appetizer menu? Let's see, can I get some fried zucchini, please?
Would you like to order anything else? No, that's it, thank you.
No problem, call me when you're ready to place the rest of your order. I would like to order my food now.
What did you want to order? Can I get a cheeseburger and some fries?
Can I get you anything else? That's all, thank you.
Did you go to school today? Of course. Did you?
I didn't want to, so I didn't. That's sad, but have you gone to the movies recently?
That's a switch. I'm serious, have you?
No, I haven't. Why? I really want to go to the movies this weekend.
So go then. I really don't want to go by myself.
Well anyway, do you plan on going to school tomorrow? No, I think I'm going to go to the movies.
Did you make it to school today? I always do. Did you go to school today?
No, I didn't. You should have, but have you seen any movies lately?
That was an odd change of subject. Maybe it was, but answer the question.
No, not recently. I want to go to see a movie this weekend.
What's stopping you then? I don't want to go alone.
So, will you be at school tomorrow? No, I want to go to the movies instead.
Did you even bother to go to school today? Yeah, I went. Did you go?
No, I didn't feel like it. That's nice, have you been to the movies lately?
No, but that was a random change of subject. It may have been random, but have you?
I haven't lately. I would love to catch a movie this weekend.
So then, why don't you just go? I don't want to see a movie by myself.
Okay, so are you going to school tomorrow? I think I might just go to the movies.
I really want to go to the beach this weekend. That sounds like fun. What's the weather going to be like?
I heard that it's going to be warm this weekend. Is it going to be perfect beach weather?
I believe so. Good. I hope it doesn't cool off this weekend.
I know. I really want to go to the beach. But you know that California weather is really unpredictable.
You're right. One minute it's hot, and then the next minute it's cold. I really wish the weather would just stay the same.
I do too. That way we can have our activities planned ahead of time. Yeah, that would make things a lot easier.
I would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend. A trip to the beach would be fun. How is the weather going to be?
The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend. So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach?
It sounds like it will be. I really hope it doesn't get cold.
That would ruin things, I want to go so badly. The weather in California is unpredictable, so you never know.
That is true. The weather is constantly changing. It would be nice if the weather would never change.
That would be great, then we could plan things sooner. True. Predictable weather would make life easier.
It would be nice to go to the beach sometime this weekend. What's the weather going to be like? I may want to go too.
The weather this weekend is supposed to be warm. Will it be good beach weather?
I think it will be. It wouldn't be good if it got cold this weekend.
I want this trip to be perfect, I hope it stays warm. This California weather is so uncertain, it's impossible to know what'll happen.
I know. Every day the weather seems different. I would love it if it wasn't always so unpredictable.
That would make it easier for us to make plans. I know. Things are easier when you know what the weather's going to be like.
I'm checking out in about half an hour. Whenever you're ready to check out, I'll be ready, sir.
Great! As you know however, the day in New York has hardly begun. You're right. It's only 9:00 a.m.
Therefore, I think I'll explore New York some more. But I need to store my bags. Sir, our storage facility is merely $5 an hour. You also need to leave a deposit.
My luggage isn't enough of a deposit? Unfortunately, it isn't. VISA or MasterCard will suffice, though.
Let me put on my thinking cap for a moment. Better hurry, sir. Remember you have to check out in less than half an hour.
I should tell you that I'm checking out in about 30 minutes. I'm ready when you are, sir.
Very good! Now, it's still morning here in New York. You are so right, sir. The clock just struck nine.
I'm going to spend some time exploring the city. What can I do with my luggage? Sir, right here we have a storage site. Its only $5 an hour, but you need to leave a deposit.
A deposit? Isn't my luggage a deposit? I'm sorry, sir, but it isn't. Your MasterCard or VISA will take care of things nicely.
Let me think about this. Okay, sir. But don't take too long. You only have 30 minutes.
Do you know that I'm checking out in about 30 minutes? Just say the word, sir.
Excellent! Now, as you know, the day has barely begun. I agree. The dew is still on the grass.
I want to hit a few more places in the city, but I need a place to put my luggage. We do have a storage space for your bags. There's a small charge, plus a deposit.
Leave a deposit? Isn't leaving the luggage enough of a deposit? Regrettably, no. But simply present your VISA to cover your deposit.
I'll have to think about this for a second. Okay, sir, but don't think too long. Your checkout is only 30 minutes away.
In case you didn't know, I'm checking out in half an hour. That won't be a problem, sir.
That's good to hear. Now there's still a whole New York day ahead of me. You're right, sir. Your whole day is still ahead of you.
I still have time to explore more of New York, but I need a place to secure my baggage. We have a storage place here, but you have to leave a deposit.
A deposit, huh? I would think my baggage would be enough of a deposit. Just present your VISA card, and there won't be any problems.
That deposit bothers me. Give me a minute. Okay, sir, but remember how close it is to your checkout time.
I'll be checking out of the hotel in about 30 minutes. Thirty minutes or 30 seconds, sir, it doesn't matter, I'm ready for you.
Great! As you know, however, the day in New York has hardly begun. There's nothing like getting an early start, sir.
What can I do with my baggage while I visit a few more tourist spots? You can leave your baggage in our storage space, with a deposit.
Isn't my baggage enough of a deposit? I wish it was, but it isn't. They will still want a credit card.
It's always something, isn't it? Let me think about this for a second.  Don't forget that you have very little time, sir, before you have to check out.
We're asking for donations today. What are you collecting donations for?
We're trying to raise money for the campaigns. How much are you planning on raising?
As much as possible. What kind of fundraisers are you doing?
We are going door to door. You should try actual fundraisers, too.
What else can we do? Try having a car wash or selling candy.
I didn't think of that. I know. It'll also help you make more money.
We're trying to get donations. What are you getting donations for?
We're getting donations for the campaigns. How much money are you looking to make?
As much as we can. Are you doing different fundraisers?
We're just going door to door. You should do something else.
Do you have any suggestions? Try a car wash and selling candy.
That is a good idea. You'll make more money that way.
Would you like to make a donation? Donations for what?
It's for the campaigns. How much money are you trying to raise?
It doesn't matter how much. What are you doing to raise money?
We go door to door asking for donations. You should try other fundraisers.
Like what? You can always wash cars and sell candy.
That's a great idea. That'll help you make more money.
My amenities bill says that I owe $10 for a movie, but I never ordered one. Let's see. It says that you were charged Monday at 9:00 p.m. for the movie Titanic.
That's absolutely wrong! I was out exploring the city Monday night. Okay, let me see what I can do.
Thank you. I didn't think it would be this simple. I can take the $10 off your bill, but I need to charge you $2 for the service.
Are you serious? I have to pay $2 for a movie I never watched? Unfortunately, sir, it's how the computer is programmed.
This is outrageous! I'm never coming back to this hotel again! I'm sorry, sir. Perhaps you'd like to write a letter to headquarters.
I just discovered that I owe $10 for a movie that I never ordered. Let me check, sir. You were charged for watching Titanic Monday night.
That is absolutely incorrect! I was out on the town Monday night. Okay, sir, bear with me a moment.
Thank you for taking my word over the computer's word. One slight problem, sir. I need to charge you $2 to remove this error from your file.
You can't be serious. You're making me pay $2 for a movie I never watched? I feel your pain, sir.
Absolutely unbelievable! You people should be ashamed of yourselves.  I agree with you, sir, but all I do is work here.
You guys are charging me $10 for a movie that I never ordered or saw. Let's see, sir. According to your file, you watched Titanic Monday evening.
The wrong information is in my file. I was at a concert Monday night. Well, your word overrules the file, sir. One moment, please.
I knew you'd see it my way. Sir, I deleted the $10, but I had to add a $2 service charge to your bill.
Am I in the Twilight Zone? You're charging me for a movie I never saw? Please don't blame me, sir. Blame the computer programmer.
This is highway robbery. I've got a good mind to call the police! If it makes you feel any better, other guests feel the same way.
Why am I being charged $10 for a movie that I never ordered? Sir, according to your file, you spent Monday evening watching Titanic.
The file is wrong. I was at a great concert that night. Well, this wouldn't be the first time that a file was wrong. Just a moment, please.
Thank you for taking care of it so quickly. Sir, when I deleted the $10, the program automatically added a $2 service charge.
You can't do that! You can't charge me for a mistake that you made! Sometimes you can't win for losing, sir.
Now I've seen it all! What a rip-off this place is! I don't blame you, sir. Two dollars is a lot of money.
I need to know why I'm being charged $10 for a movie that I never ordered. Hmm. Your file shows that you watched Titanic Monday night.
Monday night? Monday night I was at a great concert. Well, as they say, garbage in, garbage out. Let me correct this error, please.
Thank you. It's very nice when problems can be solved quickly. When I deleted the $10, the computer automatically added a $2 service charge.
Are you crazy? You made the mistake and now you're charging me for your mistake? Sir, if it makes you feel any better, the $2 service fee used to be $5.
Why don't you just stick a gun in my ribs and take everything I have? Unfortunately, sir, you'll have to pay the $2, whether you like it or not.
Can I help you with something? I need to cancel one of my accounts.
Is there a problem with it? I don't need it anymore.
What would you like to do with all the money in this account? Just transfer it over to my remaining account.
I can do that. That would be great.
Do you want to take any money out? Not today.
It's going to take a moment for me to cancel your account. That's fine. Take your time.
What can I do for you? I would like to cancel one of my accounts.
Is there a problem with your account? I only need one.
What about all your money in that account? Could you please transfer that money to my remaining account?
That's fine. I appreciate it.
Would you like to make a withdrawal? That's all for today.
I'll just cancel your account right now. I greatly appreciate your help.
Did you need help with something? I need to cancel an account.
Do you have a problem with your account? I don't need two different accounts anymore.
What are you going to do about the money in your account? Can I transfer it to my remaining account?
I'll do that for you. That's lovely.
Would you like to withdraw any money? No. That's fine.
It'll just take me a moment to cancel your account. Thank you very much.
Have the owners come up with a counter-offer to my offer to buy their home yet? The owners have counter-offered three hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars.
Should I accept their offer? There are two ways to respond. You can either come back with another offer or go with their counter-offer.
What if I make another offer, and they don't accept it? No one else has made an offer, so you could make another offer if you want to do so.
I think that I would like to offer three hundred and thirty thousand dollars as a counter-offer. OK, I will present your counter-offer to the owners tonight.
How long before I find out what their decision is? By now, the owners probably have a pretty good idea of what they will accept. It will go quickly.
Your office called and said that the owners had made a counter-offer to my offer to purchase their house. To your offer of three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, the owners have counter-offered three hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars.
I think that maybe I should accept their offer. You, of course, have two ways of responding. You can say yes or come up with another offer.
I want to make another offer, but I am afraid that they will decline and I will lose this house. There is always a chance that someone could outbid you, but you could try one more offer if you like.
I would now like to offer three hundred and thirty thousand dollars as a counter-offer. After the owners get home from work tonight, I will approach them with your offer.
Can you tell me how long it will take them to get back to me? I don't think that it will take as long as the response to the first offer.
Have the owners answered back with a counter-offer for my offer to purchase the house? In response to your offer, the sellers have decided to counter-offer three hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars.
That sounds pretty good to me, but I am not sure what to do. You can accept this offer or decline it and come up with another offer.
If I make another offer and they refuse, then what? Personally, I would consider making one more offer, but it is up to you to decide what to do.
Let's try going with three hundred and thirty thousand dollars for a counter-offer. I will contact the sellers with your current offer.
Do you think that this will move along fairly quickly? Usually the response to the second offer moves along a bit more quickly than the first one.
Excuse me. I am interested in getting a library card. Sure, let me give you an application. You can fill it out right here at the counter.
OK, here it is. Let me take a look at this for you. May I have your driver's license, please?
Here's my license and form.  You seem to have filled the form out all right. Are you familiar with our rules and fines?
Yes, I know what to do. The hours and limitations are printed on the card and this handout.
OK, I see. Thank you for joining the library we look forward to serving you.
I was wondering if you could help me to get a library card. Of course, just fill out this form and let me know when you are finished.
I'm finished. I will also need your driver's license hand me the filled-out form, please.
OK, the form is all filled out. Perfect! Do you know the hours and rules for the library?
No, I have no idea what they are. Everything you need to know is printed on the card and handout.
Yes, right. Great! You are all set to enjoy the library.
Good morning. Is this where I can get a library card issued to me? No problem, we have a short form right here just hand it to me when you are done.
I'm done. That looks great, but I will also need your driver's license or other form of I.D.
Sure, here it all is. Well, this looks nice. Do you know how to use it?
I am pretty sure how to use it, but can you remind me? Of course, just remember that all of the needed information is on the card.
I see. Well, I hope you have a wonderful time on your library visits!
I need to speak with the manager, please. Yes, this is the manager. How may I help you this morning?
We are having problems getting into our apartment. Is this the first time that you have tried this key since I gave it to you?
Yes, this is the first time that we have tried this key.  Does the key go into the lock okay?
It fits in the lock just fine. Let's try it one more time. Just try to gently slide the key in the deadbolt and turn it to the right.
It still doesn't work. I will come up to help you right away. I'll bring another key to try.
I need to speak with the manager right away. The manager is not here right now. May I take a message?
Our key doesn't seem to be working in our lock. How many times have you used this key in the lock?
We have already used this key successfully before. Does the key fit in the lock?
It is really hard to get it into the lock, but it does go in. Make sure you are on the top lock. Put the key in and try turning it to the right.
I can't get it to work. Could you return to the manager's office? I have another key that I would like you to try.
Good morning. Could I speak with the manager, please? I am the assistant manager. Is there something I can help you with?
The key you gave us to our apartment doesn't seem to be working.  Did this key work okay for you before?
We were using my roommate's key before and never really tried this one. Does the key seem to belong in that lock?
It doesn't really fit at all. Try putting your key in the top lock one more time and turn it to the right.
It works now, but it didn't work before. We have been having trouble with that lock. I will call a locksmith right away.
Are you voting tomorrow? Of course. What about you?
You know that I am. Where is your polling place?
It's at the park up the street. Oh, is that right?
Where's your polling place? I have no idea.
How come you don't know where it is? Nothing came in the mail telling me my polling place.
You should check online. Oh, really? Thanks, I'm going to do that right now.
Are you going to vote tomorrow? I sure am. How about you?
I am. Do you know where your polling place is?
My polling place is up the street at the park. Oh, really?
Where's yours at? I'm not sure.
You should know that already. I didn't receive my polling place in the mail.
You do know that you can look online, right? I didn't know that. I'll go look right now.
Are you planning on voting? Yes. Are you?
I will be voting tomorrow. What's your polling place?
My polling place is at the park up the street. Oh, yeah?
Yes, where is yours? I don't know.
How is it you don't know? The location of my polling place never came in the mail.
You can always just check online. Let me go do that.
I need to talk to you about something. What did you need to talk about?
I have some questions about my lease. Like what?
Exactly how long is my lease for? Your lease will be up in three years.
What will happen if I move out before then? If you move out before then, you will not get your deductible.
I don't understand. Because our contract says that you will live here for three years.
Okay, I think that I understand. I'm glad you understand.
Can we talk? What about?
I'm not too clear on some things about my lease. Is there a problem?
How many years is my lease for? In three years your lease will be up.
Can I move out before those three years? If you do, I will keep your deductible.
Why would you keep it? I would keep it because you would be breaking our contract.
I get it now. I hope that I cleared things up for you.
I would like to talk to you, if you have time. What's going on?
I want to discuss some things about my lease. What aren't you too sure about?
Can you tell me when my lease is up? Your lease is for three years.
If I ever decide to leave before the three years, will there be a problem? If you do, I will keep your deductible.
Why is that? If you break the contract, then you will not receive your deductible.
Oh, I see. All right. I'm glad I could clarify things for you.
Did you hear who won the election? No, who was it?
McCain is our new President. You're a liar!
I'm not happy about it, either. Who voted for him?
I guess the people wanted him as our new leader. That's the dumbest thing that I've ever heard.
I have to tell you something else that you probably won't like. What could be worse than what you just told me?
I wasn't serious, because Obama got elected. That's fantastic! You really got me there.
You heard who won the election, right? Who was elected?
McCain won the election. That can't be true!
I'm upset, too. I can't believe people voted for him.
People must want him as our President. That doesn't make any sense.
I have more bad news. How could the news get any worse?
I was only kidding, because Obama won the election. That's great news!
Have you heard who got elected? No, who won?
Our new President is John McCain. What? You can't be serious!
I was just as shocked when I found out. Why would anyone vote for McCain?
The people have spoken. That's horrible.
If you don't like that, then you're probably going to be mad at what I tell you next. More bad news?
I was just joking, and Obama is our new President. Are you serious this time? That's wonderful news.
I was wondering if you could help me use the Student Job Center. There are many ways what kind of job would you like?
I want to work in a restaurant. Fine! Will you need part-time or full-time work?
I want to work part-time. Fine, the two best ways are to use our local listings binders over there or you can use the computers with the Internet job listing sites. See them over there?
Yes, I know what to do. Well, in addition, you can schedule an appointment with a job counselor on this list. If you would like to do that, sign here, OK?
Yes, I think that would be great. Fine, well the job search tools are all here for you to use. Feel free to look around and use what works best for you. Have fun with it!
Could you help me figure out how to look for a job? We have lots of options, what type of job do you need?
I want to work in an office. Do you want to work part-time or full-time?
I want to work full-time. We have binders with local job listings or you can make use of the computers. OK?
I am confused a bit but I am sure that I can figure it out. If you make an appointment with a job counselor, they can also provide you with a lot of information. Do you want to see a counselor?
No, I don't think I need to do that. Well, you know that this job center is here for your use, so help yourself. Good luck!
What is the best way to find a job here? There are different ways of conducting a job search. Do you know what you want to do?
I don't know. Can you work part-time or full-time?
It doesn't matter right now, either one would be OK. The binders have current local jobs listings and the computer jobs lists are good too. Understand?
OK, I'll go check it out. Schedule an appointment with a counselor and you can get more information. Would that work for you?
I am not sure. Everything that you need for a successful job search is here. Happy job searching!
Do you want some dessert? No thanks. We just need our check. Have you seen the waitress?
Here comes our waitress with our check. The service here has been really great, don't you think?
Yes, the service was quite good. So, let's look at the check. The total is $36.00.
How much do you think we should leave for a tip? Usually people leave 15 percent, but this was exceptional service. I am thinking that maybe 20 percent would be appropriate.
I agree that 20 percent would be just about right. OK, so that will bring her tip to $7.20. Add it to the $36.00 and the total is $43.20.
Yes, what a nice dinner that was! We'll have to make sure to come back here again real soon.
Would you like some more coffee? No thanks. I'm full. We need to find our waitress and get our bill.
The waitress is bringing the bill right now. This waitress has really been on top of things, hasn't she?
Yes, this waitress did a great job. OK, let's see what the damage is. The total for our meal is $36.00.
What do you think would be the right amount to leave for a tip? Fifteen percent is a normal tip, but she really did a great job. What do you think about 20 percent this time?
Yes, 20 percent would be perfect. Her tip will end up being $7.20 plus the bill of $36.00. The total will be $43.20.
Yes, that was one fantastic meal! I agree. Maybe we can come back again next week.
Would you like to order anything else? No, I'm good. All we need now is our check.
The waitress is walking over here with our check even as we speak. I have never had bad service at this restaurant, but this time was really exceptional.
Yes, she really went out of her way to make this a pleasant dining experience. Let's take a look at our bill. The total price for our dinner is $36.00.
How much money should we leave for a tip? I know that 15 percent is a normal tip, but I really thought that this waitress went out of her way for us. What do you think about tipping her 20 percent?
She definitely deserves 20 percent for a tip. So we can add her tip of $7.20 to the bill of $36.00 and the total will be $43.20.
Yes, what a wonderful meal! It absolutely was a great meal. We'll have to return here for lunch sometime.
How much do you think that I should ask for my house? Well, there are a lot of factors involved in setting an asking price.
What do you look at when setting an asking price? We need to look at the selling prices for similar homes in the area. These will vary according to the condition of the home, specific location, and lot size.
Do I have to use the comparisons as the asking price for my house? No, but a seller is not going to be able to get a loan if the selling price is a lot higher that what an appraiser feels the home is worth.
Isn't it better to price my house really high and see what I can get? You shouldn't set the price of the house unrealistically high. Oftentimes buyers are put off by this practice.
Can I change my mind and lower my price if the home doesn't sell? Sure, you can always lower your asking price.
I am not sure what the asking price for my house should be. We have to take in a number of factors in setting an asking price.
What do we need to consider in establishing an acceptable price for a home? The comparisons to other similar homes in your area give us a good indication of what your home is worth. 
Is the price that we get by looking at comparisons necessarily the asking price that I have to use for my home? You don't have to use that particular asking price, but the buyer is going to have trouble getting a loan if the house is priced too high.
Should I just shoot for the moon and, if I have to lower the price, do it later? You should be realistic in your pricing. Otherwise, many potential buyers just walk away.
Can we lower the asking price later if we need to? We can always re-evaluate the asking price in a few weeks, if we aren't getting any offers.
What do you think the asking price of my home should be? There are many things to take into consideration when pricing a home.
What is involved in figuring out an asking price? We need to combine many factors regarding your home to come up with an accurate value for your home.
When you look at comparisons, do I necessarily have to ask that price? You don't have to use the price from the comparisons as your asking price. However, you must be realistic in what you ask.
I think that I am going to set the price really high so that I have room to bargain with the buyers. Don't go overboard in trying to get top dollar. More often than not, that strategy backfires.
Is it okay to lower the asking price if the first price isn't bringing in any offers? If the market doesn't support your asking price, we can always re-evaluate our pricing and adjust it.

I think I'm going to go to the market today. Do we need food?
Yes, I think so. What are you going to get?
I'm not sure what we need. Maybe you should go and look in the refrigerator.
Could you do it for me, and write out a list of things that we need? Just get the basics.
Like what? You know. Get some eggs, milk, and bread.
Just go and make a list for me, please. Fine, I'll go do that for you.

Would you please make a list for me? Okay, I'll write it down for you.
I'm going to go shopping for groceries in a little bit. Why, do we need groceries?
I believe we are all out of food. Do you know what to get?
I don't know what we need. Why don't you go and check the refrigerator?
I would appreciate it if you would do that for me. Why don't you just get the basics?
What do you mean? Eggs, milk, bread. Things like that.
Go make that list. Sure, no problem.
I was wondering if you have my test results in. I didn't see anything out of the ordinary, but I want you to log onto our website for a printout of all of the details.

I was calling to see if the buyers had accepted my counteroffer. Yes, actually they just called back with a counteroffer of their own.
Is the counteroffer close to the asking price? The counteroffer is for ten thousand less than your asking price.
I didn't really want to go that low in my pricing. I agree that that price is too low. Your home is in good shape, and you should get a better price for it.
What should I do at this point? Since you don't want to go any lower, we can notify them that you are rejecting their latest offer.
Can you take care of that for me and get back to me? I will let them know that your counteroffer was the lowest price that you will accept.
Has there been any word about whether the buyers have accepted my counteroffer? Yes, I was going to call you this morning. Your buyers have responded with a counteroffer.
Is the counteroffer a good one? They are now offering ten thousand less than your asking price.
That is really a bit lower in price than I would like to go. I think that your feelings are valid. You have a beautiful home and can afford to wait for a better offer.
What is the next step? You can flat-out reject their offer and see what they come up with.
I would like you to notify them that I am rejecting their offer. I will notify the buyers that you will not accept their counteroffer.
I was wondering if the buyers have accepted my counteroffer. Yes, I just faxed you the information an hour ago. The buyers have a counteroffer for you.
How much did they counteroffer? They now are offering to pay ten thousand less than your asking price.
I am not really ready to accept that low of a price. I wouldn't accept that price either. Your home is in a good area and should command a higher price.
Where do we go from here? We should notify them that you are rejecting their current offer. They might choose to offer a higher price.
Please let the buyers know that I am rejecting their offer. I will take care of that right away. They may or may not raise their offer.
How are you today? Great, thanks.
Can I help you? I would actually like to view the apartment for rent today.
I'm sorry, but you won't be able to view it today. Why not?

Are you available this Friday? Can we do it at 6 o'clock?
Your appointment for Friday at 6:00 pm has been confirmed. All right. I'll see you on Friday.
I was thinking about cooking dinner tonight. What do you want to make?
I'm not exactly sure. I wouldn't mind a beef bowl.
How do I make that? All it has is rice and teriyaki beef.
That sounds easy, but how do I make it? First, you need to make some white rice.
Then what do I do? Then you need to shred some beef and marinate it with teriyaki sauce.

Have you washed any clothes yet? No, I've only washed my whites.
When you wash your dark clothes, can you put some of mine in? Sure. Is there any extra care that I should take with your clothes?
Just make sure you keep it on the gentle cycle. How many clothes of yours do you want me to wash?
There isn't a lot, why, do you have a large load to wash? It's really only a small load.
Do you mind washing my clothes? Not at all. It's no problem.
Thank you so much. It's no trouble at all.
Have you finished washing clothes? I've finished my white clothes. I need to wash the rest.
When you do your darks, can you wash some of mine too? I can do that. Is there a special way you want them washed?

There aren't many clothes, is your load big? My load isn't that big.

I greatly appreciate this. Don't mention it.

Have you had enough time to look over the menu? Yes, we are almost ready to order.
Let me remind you of the specials of the day, which are posted on the board. Oh, that all sounds so good! Can we get the sauce on the side?
Yes, we would be happy to prepare the food to meet your special needs. I was wondering if you have any vegetarian choices.
Yes, the roasted vegetable salad is good, and the portabella mushroom burger is also a good choice. I think that I would like to order the broccoli noodles, please.
That is an excellent choice, and I could bring you your salads now or bring them with your dinner. Please bring our salads to us now. We are hungry!
Are you ready to order? I think that we have a pretty good idea of what we would like to order.
Let me tell you about the specials of the day, which are chicken in a wine sauce with capers, and grilled garlic shrimp. I was wondering if the chef could leave off the sauce.
The chef would be happy to accommodate your special requests. I am a vegetarian. Do you have any vegetarian selections?
You could choose the roasted vegetable and garlic pizza or the goat cheese and candied walnut salad. I think that we will split the roasted vegetable and garlic pizza.
That is a good selection, and I can bring your salads now or serve them with your entree. You can bring us our salads when you bring us our entree.
Would you like to order now? This all looks good! I think we know what we want.
Please let me point out the chef's special, which is blackened catfish. I am dieting, so could the chef prepare the food with no extra sauce?
We are always happy to adjust our cooking to meet your needs. Could you tell me if there are any entrees that are vegetarian?
The cashew broccoli noodles or the cheese and veggie enchiladas would be an excellent choice. I am going to go with the grilled shrimp with garlic sauce. I would like the garlic sauce on the side.
Would you like your salad brought to you with your entrée, or would you like it served now? You can serve our salads with our dinner.
Where should we go sightseeing today? I think that some things might be best done in the morning and others in the afternoon.
I think that I would like to go to the beach this morning. That would be a good place to start our sightseeing. We could have breakfast there.
I hear that there is a very nice natural history museum there. Yes, it would be nice to check that out since we are so close by.
Where should we go in the afternoon? I think that I would like to go to the amusement park. It's supposed to be quite good.
At the end of the day, I would love to take in the sunset at the restaurant by the park. That sounds like a great idea! Let's go get a map.
It's so hard to choose where to go first on our sightseeing trip! We could think of what would make a good morning activity versus an evening activity.
I really wanted to make sure that I got a chance to go to the local beach. I think that that would be a fun beginning to our day. We could walk around there.
I heard that the Natural History Museum is pretty close to the beach. I heard the same thing. We might as well go there since we are just down the street.
What would be a good place to go to in the afternoon? The local amusement park is supposed to be wonderful.
The restaurant on the edge of the park would be a great place to watch the sun go down. That sounds like a perfect sightseeing day to me.
There are so many places to go on our sightseeing trip that I am having trouble narrowing it down. Let's figure out what to do before lunch and later figure out what to do in the afternoon.
I heard that the local beach is a place that can't be missed. That would be a relaxing way to begin our morning. It would be good to get out in the sun.
The Natural History Museum is close by, isn't it? That museum is supposed to be fantastic!
Do you have any suggestions as to where we could go in the afternoon? We could check out the local amusement park.
We could eat dinner and watch the sun go down at that restaurant by the park. That could really end up being a great day!
I'd like to purchase a parking permit for next semester. Are you a daytime student or do you just come in the evenings?
I am a daytime student. Will you be driving a motorcycle or a car?
I will be driving my car. OK, that will be twenty-five dollars. How would you like to pay for it?
I'll pay for it with a check. Would you like to pay for any extra permits for another vehicle?
No, thanks I'm fine. Here you go then. Have a great school year!
I'll need a parking permit for next semester. Do you attend school during the day or only at night?
I only attend class part-time in the evenings. Do you drive a motorcycle or an automobile? 
I have both, but I usually use my car to get to school. Great, the price for that permit is thirty dollars cash, check, or credit card?
I'll pay cash. Do you need to buy a duplicate permit for a second vehicle?
No, thank you. OK, here is your permit enjoy the new semester.
I want to buy a parking permit, please. Are you a full-time student or do you attend part-time in the evenings?
I attend both day and evening classes. Will you be riding a motorcycle or do you drive a car?
I ride a motorcycle. That permit will run twenty-five dollars will that be cash or credit card?
I'll use a credit card, thank you. Do you need a second permit for a car?
No, just the motorcycle permit. Fine, here it is and have a great semester!
Is there anything special I need to think about as I tour this city? You need to keep in mind that this is a very poor country. Things are a little more desperate here than you are used to.
What do I need to look for? Be particularly vigilant anytime you are in a crowded place with other tourists. Pickpockets know that tourists aren't paying all that much attention.
I have seen many children on the street begging, so what do I do about them? It is best not to give money to children or other beggars on the street, as they can swarm you. You can give money to a local charity.
Should I be concerned about what I eat or drink? Do not drink any water that isn't bottled. Avoid street vendor food.
How about being out on the street at night? I would take a cab to your destination at night. Don't walk down the street alone.
This city is much larger than the one I live in, and I wonder if there is anything special that I need to keep in mind. Crime can happen anywhere, but it is a little worse here because of the poverty.
Should I be vigilant about anything in particular? The train stations, airports, and tourist sites are favorite spots for pickpockets.
When I see children on the street begging, what amount should I give them? I wouldn't suggest giving money to them. Most of them are put out there by adults who then take their money.
Can I eat or drink anything I want to? Do not use tap water at all, not even to brush your teeth. Only eat fruit that has been peeled.
Can I walk around and see the sights at night? I would be sure to travel in a group at night. Stay in well-lit areas.
Do I need to take any special safety precautions in this city? This is a very large city with a lot of crowds to work your way through. Keep in mind that poverty makes people a little more desperate.
What should I watch out for? You have to pay special attention at train stations, airports, and tourist sites. They are known for having a lot of pickpockets.
There are so many children begging on the street that I don't know which ones to give money to. It is a natural instinct to want to give money to those children, but it is better to give money to one of the local charities or schools.
Are the local food and drink safe? Avoid eating food prepared by street vendors. Use only bottled water.
How safe is it to be out at night? You should always travel with others at night and stick to well-lit areas.
I am checking out. Here is the key to my room. Thank you. I'll just print out your receipt, and then you're free to go. Here you go!
Thanks. If you don't mind me asking, how did you enjoy your stay at New York Hotel?
This hotel could use some insecticide, but my time in New York was thoroughly delightful. That's very honest of you. Rest assured that this hotel will have no insects next time.
I want to check out. Here is my room key. One second, sir, while I print out your receipt. Here you are.
Thanks. May I ask, sir, if you enjoyed your stay?

I'm leaving. Here is my key. Just one second, sir, and I'll give you your receipt. Here you go.
Thank you very much. Sir, did you enjoy your stay here?
Most of my time here was pleasant. And New York itself is fantastic. I'm glad you enjoyed the city, anyway. But please don't think too unkindly of us.
I'm out of here. Here's my key. Give me just a few seconds, sir, and I'll hand you your receipt. Here you are.
I thank you. I hope you enjoyed your stay, sir.
I only had nine little problems here. Other than that, I enjoyed my stay, and I loved the city. I apologize again for the cockroaches, sir. I hope you have a nice trip home.
My stay is over. Here's the key to my room. Thank you. And here's your receipt, sir.
Many thanks. I hope your stay here was satisfactory, sir.
This could be a great hotel, once you get rid of the insects. The city itself is great. I'm glad that the little problem didn't ruin your visit. Please have a pleasant trip home.
This visit is over for me. Here's your room key. Thank you for that, and in return, here's your receipt.
And thanks to you. I hope you'll visit us again, sir.
I'd be willing to try this hotel again, if you can promise me no more cockroaches. I guarantee you that our little "friends" won't be back. I hope your trip home is pleasant.

What is that plastic cup for? Your doctor has requested a urine sample.
Am I supposed to pee into the cup? We want what we call a clean sample. Urinate a drop or so into the toilet, and then stop the flow and urinate into the cup.
Then what do I do with the cup? You put the cup in the little cubby in the restroom and close the door to the cubby.
What is this test for? He is looking to see if you have a bladder or urinary tract infection.
When will I know the results? Your doctor will call you in a few days with the results.
Why are you handing me a plastic cup? Your doctor wants to test your urine and needs a sample.
How am I supposed to do that? We need you to urinate like you normally would, and then stop and finish into the cup.
What am I supposed to do with the cup when I am done? Leave the cup in the cubby in the restroom. Just close the cubby door and walk away.
What kind of test is this? He wants to know if you have bacteria in your urine, which could signal an infection.
How long will it take to get the results? We will send your doctor the results, and he will contact you.
What am I supposed to do with this plastic cup? That cup is for a urine sample.
How, exactly, does this work? This particular test calls for you to urinate into the cup after you have urinated a little into the toilet.
When I finish, what should I do then? You need to leave the cup in the cubby in the restroom, and the lab tech will get it from the other side.
What is my doctor testing me for? If there are bacteria in your urine, it could mean an infection somewhere.
Will I know the results right away? Your doctor will be contacting you with the results.
I'd like to request some more amenities. Amenities? What do you mean by amenities, sir?
The free stuff, you know, the soap, lotion, shampoo, etc. I see. Sir, if I may ask: Have you used up all the amenities in your room?
Not at all. I still have enough for the next few days. Then what is the problem, sir?
I need some to keep as souvenirs! Souvenirs?
Yes, souvenirs. Trinkets to remember my trip by! We do have a souvenir shop on the first floor, sir.
That's not the same. I never pay for hotel souvenirs! I'll call housekeeping. Someone will be up with more amenities shortly.
I need more amenities, please. Could you be a little more specific, sir?
To be more specific, the free stuff, like soap, lotion, and shampoo. I understand. Now, you're saying that you've already used up all your amenities?
No! I've got all I need for my stay here. So, what's the problem?
I need souvenirs! You want some souvenirs!
Yes, yes. Souvenirs. But, sir, our souvenir shop carries all those items.
That's not the same thing. If you buy hotel souvenirs, they have no sentimental value. I understand, sir. I'll call housekeeping. You'll have your souvenirs shortly.
How do I get more amenities? I'm sorry, sir. I'm not sure I understand.
I'm talking about the free stuff, like soap and shampoo. Oh, I see. So, you're saying that you've already run out of your amenities.
No, no. I've got plenty left. Now I'm confused again! What is the problem?
What am I going to do about souvenirs? Oh, I get it! You want souvenirs!
Yes, I've got enough soap for my use, but no extra soap for souvenirs. Sir, our souvenir shop carries all those items, and as a guest you get a discount.
Please! Free souvenirs are the only true souvenirs. I understand completely, sir. Housekeeping will bring you souvenirs in just a moment.
Yes, I need more amenities. By amenities, exactly what do you mean, please?
You know, the things that are free, like the soap and the shampoo. Okay, I got it. You've already run out of all your amenities?
No, I still have plenty left, even if I took three baths a day. I'm more confused now than before. How is there a problem?
I need to take home some souvenirs! Okay, finally I understand. You would like souvenirs!
Yes, souvenirs that I can take home and add to my collection. If it's souvenirs you want, sir, just visit our souvenir shop. It has everything.
Are you kidding? Whoever heard of paying for hotel souvenirs? No problem at all, sir. Housekeeping will deliver you all the amenities you like in a bit.
I need some more amenities, please. I'm not sure I'm following you, sir.
Specifically, I'm talking about the little things, like soap and shampoo. Oh, now I understand! So, you've already used up all your amenities?
No, I'm not even halfway through my supply. I'm losing you, sir. What's the problem?
What's the use of going to a hotel if you don't take home souvenirs? Okay, I got it. You're collecting souvenirs!
There you go. My friends expect me to bring home souvenirs. Have you visited our souvenir shop, sir? It's loaded with all kinds of items.
I've never paid for a hotel souvenir in my life, and I don't intend to start now. Sir, housekeeping will bring you a basketful of amenities momentarily.
Can you help me with returning my late books? This is the right spot to pay your fee. Put your books down right here.
OK, here they are. I can see that you owe 25 cents a day. That will be one dollar and fifty cents total.
OK, here's the money. We are interested in getting our books back so as long as all the fines are paid off by the end of the semester, you will be fine. Does that make sense?
I'm not sure. Your registration and transcripts can be held up if there is an outstanding fine.
Now I understand. Well, you can always keep your late fees down by using the night drop if we are closed. Enjoy the library!
These books should have been turned in last week. You have come to the correct place. Hand me your books.
Here they are. Whoa, these are pretty late! You owe five dollars total to clear your fine.
I don't have the money right now. We only require that all fines must be paid off by the end of the semester. So you will be okay to go.
What would happen if I didn't pay it? It's really important to always clear your fines, so you'll get a report card and transcripts on time.
Yeah, but I don't know how they can do that. Always remember that the night drop is here, and we really appreciate you returning your books for all to use.
My library books are late, where can I put them? This is where they need to be turned in. Let me see them to check the date, OK?
Yeah, I think that they are really late! Not all that late. You only owe the library fifty cents.
What if I can't pay it? We appreciate you paying off all fines as soon as possible, but always before the end of the semester.
Yeah, I get it. Your report card and transcripts will be held until you pay all fines, so always make sure that you do that.
That's not really fair! If we aren't here, always feel free to use the night drop outside. Thanks for coming in!
How are you doing today? I've been having trouble breathing lately.
Have you had any type of cold lately? No, I haven't had a cold. I just have a heavy feeling in my chest when I try to breathe.
Do you have any allergies that you know of? No, I don't have any allergies that I know of.
Does this happen all the time or mostly when you are active? It happens a lot when I work out.
I am going to send you to a pulmonary specialist who can run tests on you for asthma. Thank you for your help, doctor.
What brings you to my office today? I've been getting really short of breath, and my coach wanted to have a doctor check me out.
Have you had the flu lately? No, I have been pretty healthy. I just have trouble taking a really deep breath.
Have you ever been tested for allergies? Peaches make me break out, but I don't have any other allergies.
Does this happen all the time or maybe a little more in the cold weather? I've noticed that it is worse when I am under stress, like during finals week.
I feel that you should see a pulmonary specialist to check for asthma. I appreciate the referral, doctor.
Good morning, how have you been doing? I haven't been able to take a deep breath lately, and I need to know why.
Have you had any type of bug lately? No, I've been feeling fairly good most of the time. It just is hard to breathe.
Has anyone ever told you that you have allergies? No one has ever checked me for allergies.
Does this happen more when you are under stress? When the weather gets really cold, it gets worse.
I am going to refer you to a pulmonary specialist who can run tests on you for asthma. Thank you for pursuing this. I appreciate your help.
Thank you for coming. You're welcome. What's the problem?
I have a leaky pipe. Where exactly is the pipe?
The pipe is behind a wall in my bathroom. How long has the pipe been leaking?
It began leaking a couple of days ago. I must tell you that in order to get to the pipe, I must tear down that wall.
I know. That won't be a problem?
Not as long as it gets fixed. All right, I will start working now.
Thank you for coming so quickly. No problem. What's wrong?
A pipe in my apartment is leaking. Where is the pipe?
The pipe is in my bathroom. Can you tell me how long the pipe has been leaking?
The pipe has been leaking for a couple days. You do realize that I will need to rip down your wall to get to the pipe, right?
Yes, I'm aware of that. Is that all right?
I just need the problem fixed. I'll get started on it now.
I'm glad you could make it. It's my job. What can I help you with?
I think a pipe burst in my apartment. In what room is this pipe?
You'll find the pipe in my bathroom. When did the pipe start leaking?
It's been leaking for a couple of days now. I will need to tear down that wall to fix that pipe.
I understand. You're fine with that?
I just want the problem taken care of. Okay. I will begin working on it now, if you'd like.
What do you think? It looks great.
I would like to purchase it. Will this be cash or charge?
Here, take my credit card. Just sign here, please.
Sure. Here you go. Here's your receipt. Have a nice day.
Does it look too big? It looks like it was made just for you.
Yes, I like it. I'm going to get it. How would you like to pay for it?
Here's my credit card. Now, if you'll just sign here.
Yes. Here you are. So long. Have a nice weekend.
Does it look too small? It fits you to a T.
I agree. I'm going to buy it. Cash or charge?
I'll charge it. Sign here, please.
There you go. Good-bye, and thank you for shopping here.
Does it look like a good fit? It's definitely your size.
Yes, it is very nice. I'll take it. How do you prefer to pay?
Let me use my credit card. Now, if you'll just sign here.
No problem. I hope you enjoy your purchase. Good-bye.
How does it look? It's a perfect fit.
Let me pay for it now. Cash, credit card, or debit card?
I think I'll use my credit card. Your signature here, please, and we're finished.
Here's my John Hancock. Bye-bye. Visit us again soon!
What's for dinner tonight? It's whatever you're planning on cooking.
You're not going to cook? No, I always cook.
Yes, and I love your cooking. Don't give me that. If you're hungry, then cook dinner.
You're being serious? Look, I'm really tired tonight. I don't feel like cooking dinner.
I'll make dinner tonight. Thank you. I'm going to bed.
Do you want me to wake you up when dinner is ready? Yes, please.
What are we going to eat for dinner? Whatever meal that you plan on making.
I thought you were making dinner tonight. I do all the cooking.
Your food tastes so much better than mine. Save it. If you want something to eat, then make it yourself.
You really want me to cook tonight? I had a long day today. I really am not in the mood to make anything.
No problem. Thanks. I'm going to go take a nap.
Would you like me to come get you when the food is done? Thank you.
So, what's on the menu for dinner tonight? You tell me.
You're not going to make anything to eat? You never cook. I always do.
I think you're a better cook than I am. Oh please, you need to cook tonight.
So you're telling me that you want me to make dinner? It was a hard day. Can you just do this for me tonight?
I'll cook dinner, don't worry. I'm going to go rest for a little bit.
I'll come wake you when it's ready, okay? Thanks.
I have a question about extra people living with me in my apartment. You may have one roommate, but they need to have an approved application on file with us.
What about overnight guests? An occasional overnight guest is not a problem.
How many days could I have an extra guest? We usually consider any guest who stays over a week to be a possible problem.
Will I have to pay extra for roommates or visitors? If you are given permission for extended visitors, you may be charged extra.
Can my guests use the pool and laundry room? Your guests may use the pool and laundry facilities, but you must be with them at all times.
Can I have roommates in my apartment? You may have one roommate, but they need to pass a credit check.
Can overnight guests stay with me? You may have an overnight guest, but they may not stay for an extended period of time.
How long could my friends and family stay with me without it being a problem? No one can stay with you for over a week without special permission.
Will I owe extra money for more people staying in my apartment? You are not charged extra for a roommate or short-term guests.
If I have visitors, may they use the pool? Your short-term guests may use the facilities with you present.
What about roommates in my apartment? You may have one roommate, but their name must appear on the lease.
Can I have someone visit me for a short period of time? We understand that a family member or friend may visit from time to time. Just make sure that they are not moving in with you.
How many days could a friend stay without it being a problem? You cannot have an extra tenant for over a week, unless we give you special permission.
Will I be charged extra money for having roommates or visitors? A roommate or a short-term guest would not cost you anything extra.
Can my family and friends use the facilities when they visit me? Your guests may not use the facilities unless you are with them.
Is this where I catch the Super Shuttle? Yes, this is where you catch the Super Shuttle. Where are you headed?
I am headed home to Pasadena. You can tell where each van is headed by the name on the front of the van. I am the driver for Glendale, but your van should be along in a minute.
Do you know how much it costs to get to Pasadena? I believe the cost of that trip is sixty dollars.
Do you know if the shuttle goes directly to Pasadena, or does it make a lot of stops? Before you pay the driver, you need to ask him. He needs to be upfront with you about the number of stops he will be making.
Do I need to have exact change? You don't need exact change, but it is useful to have smaller bills.
They told me inside that I should catch the Super Shuttle here. You are in the right place to catch the Super Shuttle. What is your destination?
I am trying to get to my home in Pasadena. Look at the sign on the front of the van to tell where each van is headed. My van is going to Glendale, but yours will be along in minute.
How much does a trip to Pasadena cost? If I remember correctly, that trip costs sixty dollars.
I am hoping that this shuttle goes straight to my city without making a bunch of stops. Always ask the driver how many stops he plans to make before you pay him.
If I have large bills, should I break them while I am waiting? It is better if you have cash close to the amount of the fare. There is an ATM machine right over there.
Am I in the right place to catch the Super Shuttle? This is the Super Shuttle stop. Where are you trying to get to?
My final destination is my home in Pasadena. The destination of each van is always written across the top. I have Glendale written on mine, but your van will be here shortly.
What is the price of a shuttle trip to Pasadena? The trip to Pasadena costs sixty dollars.
I need to know if this shuttle is going to make a lot of stops or go straight to Pasadena. If you find out the driver will be making too many stops on the way, you may wish to wait for a more direct shuttle.
What should I pay the driver with? There is an ATM machine over by that wall. It is best if you have bills close to the amount that you will owe.
I don't know how much luggage I can take on the plane with me. You need to look up each individual airline online to get their restrictions.
I just wonder what the general rules are. In the United States, if you fly economy on a domestic flight, you usually have to pay for checked baggage.
What about international flights? On international flights, you usually have a two-bag limit with weight restrictions.
What about carry-on bags? All airlines will allow you to bring one small carry-on that will fit under the seat. Sometimes you can also bring a purse or handbag. 
Do you have any words of wisdom for travelers in regard to luggage? Keep it light in regard to what you pack. Figure out what you absolutely need and leave the rest at home.
I am getting packed for my vacation and don't know what the luggage restrictions are. You could call the airline that you will be flying, and they can tell you what you can bring.
I just need to know what most of the airlines have decided to do. Unless you fly on a discount carrier, you usually have to pay a fee for checked baggage if you fly economy.
Do I also have to pay on an international flight? Some international airlines charge a fee for extra bags or weight but allow you a free bag.
How much carry-on luggage may I bring? You may bring a carry-on piece of luggage, and usually you can bring a handbag also.
What overall suggestions do you have regarding travelers and luggage? Do not bring anything on a trip that you don't really need. Think of it as leaving space for anything that you might want to purchase along the way!
I heard that the airlines are changing the luggage restrictions, and I need to find out what they are. There are online sites that list the general restrictions of the airlines.
Because I fly a lot, I need to pack in a way that will be suitable for most airlines. Except for the discount carriers, you almost always have to pay a fee for checked baggage if you fly economy within the U.S.
Do they charge a fee for baggage on an international flight? Almost all international carriers charge for excessive luggage. You are limited in weight and size.
Is carry-on luggage allowed? You are restricted in what you may carry on. You almost always can bring one small piece for free.
What do you think is the most important thing to remember when packing for a trip? Pack lightly! You don't want to haul around or pay fees on things that aren't essential.
How may I help you? I'm having a problem.
What is it? I apparently owe some fees, but I never got the bank statement.
I do apologize for that. My fees went up, but I didn't even know I had fees to pay. 
I see your problem. What are you going to do about it?
I will cancel the fees you owe. I don't have to pay any fees?
You'll only have to pay the initial fee. That's fine. I appreciate your help.
What can I do for you? I have a serious problem.
Explain it to me. I never got a bank statement for fees that I owe.
I'm sorry, but I guess we didn't send a statement out. My fees increased, because I didn't know about my fees. 
I see where that is a problem. Can you fix it?
I will cancel the fees that you owe. You're canceling all the fees?
You still need to pay the initial fee. That'll be fine.
May I help you? I have a problem.
What's your problem? I owe fees, but a bank statement never came in the mail about it.
I apologize for the inconvenience. I have no idea about the fee, so my fees went up. 
I understand your problem. Will you be able to solve my problem?
I'm going to cancel the fees you owe. So, I don't have to pay any of it?
The initial fee still must be paid. That's fabulous. Thank you very much.
I would like to buy some business cards. Excellent. How many would you like?
Two thousand would be fine. You need to fill out this form, please.
All I want is the same thing on this card. That will be no problem, sir.
I'm finished. Here's your form and my old card. Very good, sir. Your order will be ready in one week.
Do you think you could finish it in three days? No problem, sir. But it will cost you extra.
I need to purchase some business cards. No problem. How many are you thinking about?
I think 2,000 would be fine. If you'll just fill out this form, please.
I want the new cards to be exactly like this card. We can do that very easily.
I'm done. Here's the form and my old card. Great. Your order will take only one week.
You know, I think it would be better if I could pick it up in three days. We can do that. It'll just cost you extra.
I need to get some business cards printed up. Do you know how many you need?
I think I can get by with 2,000. We can get started as soon as you fill out this form.
I hope you can make the new cards just like my old cards. You won't be able to tell the difference with a magnifying glass.
I'm through. Here's the form and my old card. Very good. You can pick up your order in one week.
Now that I think of it, three days is better than seven. We can do that, but you'll have to pay a little extra.
I need to order new business cards. Do you have any idea how many you'd like?
I think 2,000 would be enough. Would you fill out this form, please?
I don't want to make any changes to my old card. If you detect any difference, I'll take you out to dinner.
That's it. Here's the form, and here's my old card to use as a model. Thank you. Your order will be ready seven days from now.
I need it sooner. Let me have it in three days, okay? We can certainly give you faster turnaround, but it will cost you extra.
I'm about to run out of business cards. I need some new ones. We can print as many as you like. Just tell me how many.
Two thousand should get me through the year. Here's a form to get you started.
My old card is perfect, so all I want you to do is copy it exactly. I think you'll be very pleased with how well we duplicate your old card.
Here you go, your form and my old business card. Thanks. Come back here next Wednesday to pick up your order, please.
I'm sorry, but can you give me a three-day turnaround? If you don't mind paying a little extra, it's absolutely no problem.
I am interested in selling my home and would like to know what is involved. You have come to the right place. When were you interested in selling your home?
I just received a job transfer and need to relocate right away. How long have you been in your current home?
I have lived in my home for about 10 years. As I am sure that you are aware, the market has fallen in the past year. People are more likely to make money if they have owned their home for a while.
Will I be able to recover the money I paid for my home? It is hard to say, but whatever house you buy will also be costing you a lot less.
What is the next step in selling my home? I would like to meet with you tomorrow to look at your property, and then you and I can figure out a contract.
I am looking for a realtor to help me sell my home. I would be happy to help you with any questions that you might have. When were you thinking of selling your home?
I am interested in moving up to a bigger home, but first I need to sell the one I now own. Have you owned your home for a long time?
I just bought my home two years ago. I think you probably know that the market is not all that great. You are more likely to see a profit if you have owned for 8 years or more.
Will I be losing money if I sell right now? It is impossible to predict with certainty what will happen, but you can purchase a replacement home at a lower rate also.
What can I do next to get the ball rolling on this sale? If it works for you, I would like to come over and see your home. Then we can draw up a contract.
I am considering selling my home and would like information on doing so. It would be my pleasure to answer any questions that you might have. Were you interested in selling in the near future?
I am just checking out the possibility of selling, as I am thinking of moving to Hawaii. Is your home a recent purchase, or have you owned it for a while?
The house has been in my family for years, but I just became the owner 6 months ago when my mother passed away. Housing prices have fallen quite a bit. The longer you have owned your home, the greater the profit.
Am I going to lose my shirt selling my home right now? It will all kind of even out. You may sell low, but you can also buy low.
What should we be doing to get the process started? If it fits into your schedule, I could meet you tomorrow morning and we could take a look at your property. The next step would be us both signing a contract.
Your total comes to $36.78. Put it on my VISA.
There's a problem with your card. What's wrong with it?
I believe it was declined. You're kidding me!
Do you have another card I could try? I only have one card.
Do you have cash, perhaps? I don't have any cash on me.
You're not going to be able to take these items today. I'll be back tomorrow.
The total for all these items comes to $36.78. Take my VISA.
There is something wrong with your card. What's going on?
Your card was declined. That can't be right!
Would you like me to try another card? I don't have another one.
What about cash? I didn't bring cash with me today.
I'm sorry, but you can't take the items until you can buy them. I'll come back for them tomorrow.
You owe $36.78. Here's my VISA card.
I'm sorry, but your card isn't working. What's the problem?
The machine says your card was declined. It was?
Do you have another card? That's my only one.
Maybe you can just pay in cash? No cash today.
I guess you won't be able to purchase these items today. I'll come tomorrow with cash.
I'm hungry. You already ate.
It wasn't enough, because I'm hungry again. There's nothing left from dinner.
I'm going to get a snack. What kind of snack are you going to make?
I don't know. You can always make a sandwich.
I don't know what kind of sandwich I want. Just make yourself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
I may just do that. Go right ahead.
I am starving. Didn't you just eat?
I'm still hungry. We ate everything from dinner.
I just need a snack. What are you going to make?
I don't have the slightest clue. Go make a sandwich.
I'm not sure what kind I want. Why don't you make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?
I think I will do that. Maybe you should.
I need to eat something. You just ate.
I know, but I'm hungry again. There's no food left from dinner.
I think I'm going to go make myself a snack. Do you know what kind of snack that you want?
I'm not exactly sure. Why don't you make yourself a sandwich or something?
I have no idea what kind of sandwich I want to make. A PB&J is pretty easy to make.
I'm going to do that. Knock yourself out.
Hello, this is Betty. Hi, Betty. Larry here. How many smoke detectors are in your apartment?
Actually, I have two. Are the batteries fresh?
Both batteries are good. Great. I need to come by and check them myself.
No problem, when are you coming by? Thursday at noon. I'll let myself in if you're not there.
Okay, remember to lock my door when you leave. I'll be in and out of there in just a few minutes.
Hello, this is Betty. Hello, Betty. This is Larry. How many smoke detectors are on your ceiling?
I have two smoke detectors. Do you have fresh batteries in both of them?
Both batteries are pretty fresh. Very good. I have to come by there and check out all the detectors.
Very good, when do you think you'll be coming over? I'll be by on Thursday at noon. You don't have to be there.
I won't be home. Just remember to lock my door, okay? You won't even know that I've been there.
Hello, Betty speaking. Hey, Betty. This is Larry. Tell me how many smoke detectors you have, please.
This apartment came with one, and I installed another one. Are there fresh batteries in each of them?
Each detector beeps when the battery is low. They're not beeping. Good. I'm calling all the tenants because I have to check all the detectors.
Okay, What day were you thinking about dropping by? I'll be at your building at noon on Thursday. If you're not there, I'll let myself in.
If you're thirsty, you can grab a beer or soda out of my frig. Thanks, but it'll only take me about two minutes to test them and leave.
Hi, this is Betty. Hi, Betty. It's Larry. I need to know how many smoke detectors are in your apartment.
There was one when I moved in. Then I added one. Do both detectors have fresh batteries?
I always keep them fresh. I don't want to burn to death. That's good. I have to come by there and check out all of the detectors.
Not a problem. When will you be here? I'll be letting myself into all the apartments on Thursday at noon.
If it's raining, make sure you wipe your feet before you come inside, okay? Not to worry. I'll be in and out of your place in a flash.
Hi, this is Betty. Hi, Betty. It's Larry. Can you tell me how many smoke detectors you have?
There are two smoke detectors in my apartment. Do you know how new the batteries are?
I'm very afraid of fires. I change the batteries every Labor Day. Good. I'm calling all the tenants before I come by to test the detectors.
My detectors are ready for you. When will you be visiting? This Thursday at noon. But you don't have to be there.
Okay, just pardon the mess when you come in. You'll never even know that I was there.
Why weren't you at school yesterday? I wasn't really feeling well.
What was wrong with you? My stomach was upset.
Do you feel better now? I don't really feel too well yet.
Do you want anything to make you feel better? No, thanks. I already took some medicine.
I hope you feel better. Thank you.
What reason do you have for missing school? I was sick.
How were you sick? I had a stomachache.
Did it get any better? I'm still feeling under the weather.
Would you like anything for your stomach? I took something earlier.
Get better. Thanks a lot.
Why didn't you go to school yesterday? I stayed home because I wasn't feeling well.
What was your problem? My stomach was bothering me.
Are you feeling any better? I'm still feeling a little sick.
I'm going to the store, would you like any Pepto Bismol? That's okay.
I hope you feel better. I'd appreciate that.
How are you doing? Great. What's up?
I wanted to talk to you about something. What did you want to talk about?
I just wanted to let you know that I'm moving out. When?
In the next few weeks. I don't understand why you want to move.
I'm going to school out of state. I see. That'll be fine.
Thanks for understanding. Yes. I'm fine with it.
How are you? I'm all right. What did you need?
We need to talk. What's going on?
I'm going to be moving out. When exactly are you planning on moving out?
I'm going to be moving in a few weeks. Why are you going to move?
I'm leaving the state to go to school. I can understand that.
So you're fine with it? Yeah, I understand.
How have you been? I'm fine. What's going on?
I would like to talk to you about something. What about?
I'm planning on moving out soon. When will you be doing this?
I will be moving out a few weeks from now. Why is that?
I have to leave the state for school. That's all right.
I'm glad that you're okay with this. I'm absolutely cool with it.

I really like this beautiful apartment! Thank you. Do you have any further questions?
Yes, I was wondering about safety features. Yes, what are your concerns?
How about fire alarms and escape routes? Every apartment has its own smoke alarm, and the whole building is on a sprinkler system.
What about fire extinguishers? They are in the hallways on all of the floors. It is suggested that you buy an individual one for your own apartment.
What about escape routes in a fire? The escape routes are clearly posted in the hallways.
This apartment is everything that I am looking for! Thank you. Is there any other information that you need?
Could you tell me a little about safety features? Yes, we have thought of safety. What, specifically, are you interested in?
Are your fire alarms up to code? In case of a fire, we have a whole building sprinkler system. In addition, every apartment has its own alarm system.
Do you have fire extinguishers available? Yes, there are fire extinguishers outside your door. You might want to buy a personal one for your kitchen.
Are the escape routes clearly posted somewhere? There are fire exit signs in the hallway.
What a great apartment! Thanks. Can I answer any questions for you at this point?
Have you put any safety features into this building? Yes, your safety is of concern to us. What specifically were you interested in?
Can you talk about fire safety? We have a global sprinkler system for the building and individual alarms for each apartment.
Are there fire extinguishers anywhere? There are fire extinguishers in the hallways. If I were you, I would buy a personal one for the kitchen.
How do I exit the building in case of a fire? There is a card that has escape routes posted on the inside of your front door.
Can I help you find something? I would like to buy a new fridge.
Is there one in particular that you like? I was looking at this Kenmore refrigerator.
Ah yes, that is a great refrigerator. What's so great about it?
It's both affordable and it comes with all the appliances. What appliances?
It comes with an ice maker, water dispenser, and there is a lot of room inside. May I see the inside for myself?
Be my guest. Wow! You're right! This refrigerator is great. I'll take it.
Do you need help with something? I need help finding a new refrigerator.
Do you see anything that you like? That Kenmore looks nice.
That is a wonderful choice. What makes is so great?
It's very inexpensive, and it has all the appliances. What appliances are you talking about?
The fridge and freezer is very spacious, and it also has an ice maker and water dispenser. May I take a look inside?
Take a look inside. It's very nice. I'd like to purchase this refrigerator.
What can I do for you today? I need to buy a new refrigerator today.
Were you looking at a particular refrigerator? I like that Kenmore refrigerator.
This particular refrigerator is a very good choice. Tell me about it.
Not only is it affordable, but it comes with all the appliances. What are the appliances.
It has an ice maker, water dispenser, and plenty of room on the inside. I'd like to see it for myself.
Go right ahead. I like what I see.
Can you believe that Obama is our new President? I'm so happy about that.
Did you vote for him? I sure did. How about you?
I voted for him. I have complete confidence in our new President.
Is that right? I know he will help change America.
I hope so, because America needs a change. I feel like things are already changing, because he was elected.
I agree with you completely. I'm not worried about our country now that it's in his hands.
I can't believe Obama is our President. I am proud to know that he is our President.
You voted for him, right? Did you vote for him, because I know that I did.
I did, too. I have nothing but faith in Obama.
Really? I'm sure he will help better America.
We do need some change in this country. Our country is already changing as it is.
You're absolutely right. I trust that he will take good care of our country.
Can you believe that Obama was actually elected? I can believe it, and I am very excited about it.
I hope you voted for him. Of course I did. Didn't you?
Of course! I have total faith in Obama as our President.
You do? Yeah. I have faith that he will help America turn over a new leaf.
Our country really could use some work. I believe that change has already begun.
I couldn't agree more. I no longer need to worry about what will happen with this country.
Hi, could you help me find a place where I could buy some lunch? Sure! What kind of food would you like?
I was thinking of pizza or something else Italian, maybe. I know the perfect place!
Good! Where is it? It's right past that last building on the left. Do you want me to go with you?
That would be great. Glad you asked me to join you. This will be fun!
Man, I'm hungry. Do you know a good place to have lunch? Yes, I know a great place. What types of food do you like?
Mexican, Japanese or Chinese would be great. Oh, I know a place where you might like to eat.
Is it close by? It's down a block on the right can I show you the way?
OK, I'd love the company. This will work out well. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.
Let's have some lunch do you know of a great restaurant somewhere? I'm hungry, too. What types of food sound good?
Maybe just a quick sandwich, salad, or something. I have a great idea of where you might like to go.
Can we walk there? It's on the second floor. May I join you?
Of course! Let's go. Let's hurry. I'm starving!
Yes, this is John Smith. John, this is Terry Evans. I called to tell you I have good news.
Great, what is it? The owner has approved your rental application. He enjoyed talking to you.
That's great. He seemed like a really nice guy. Now, before you can move in, you need to pay some fees.
Fees, what kind of fees? You know. First and last month's rent and security deposit.
Oh, those fees! First and last is $2,500, and the deposit is $1,000. Just send me a check for $3,500.
No problem, what's your address? Send it to 3035 E. Foothill Blvd., Pasadena, CA 91107.
So, when can I move in? The first of next month. Just stop by my office and pick up your keys.
Very good! Let me have your phone number. Sure. It's 626-555-3000.
John speaking. John, my name is Terry Evans. I have good news for you.
I'm all ears. What is it? Your rental application has been approved. The owner thinks you'll be an excellent tenant.
Oh, that's so good. It makes my day. Now, before you move in, you have to pay some fees.
Fees, what are you talking about? You know--first and last month's rent, and the security deposit.
Oh, of course. When you said fees, I was thinking of parking fees or something. That will come to $3,500, 2,500 plus $1,000. You can send me the check.
I'll do that immediately. Where do I send it? Mail it to 3035 E Foothill Blvd, Pasadena, CA 91107.
One more question. When can I move in? You can move in on the first. Stop by here and pick up your keys.
Great! What's your phone number? My number is 626-555-3000.
I'm John Smith. How can I help you? Hi, John. This is Terry Evans. I've got some good news for you.
I hope you're from the lottery. Go ahead. The apartment owner was impressed with your interview. He has approved your rental application.
Oh, my gosh. That's wonderful news! Of course, there are some fees to pay before you move in.
Fees? I don't remember anything about fees. You know, the usual--first and last month's rent, and the security deposit.
But, of course. You cannot move in unless you pay such fees. So, you can write me a check for $3,500. That's $2,500 and $1,000 deposit.
No sooner said than done. Where shall I mail it? Just mail it to 3035 E. Foothill Blvd., Pasadena, CA 91107.
So, when will I be able to move in? Move in on the first. Come on by my office, and pick up your keys.
Sounds great! Tell me your phone number. Certainly. My office number is 626-555-3000.
Yes, this is John Smith. How may I help you? Hello, John. Terry Evans here. I'm happy to give you some good news.
What is it? The apartment owner likes you. He has approved your rental application.
Oh, thank you. That's the news I was hoping to hear! Before you move in, of course, you have to pay some fees.
Fees, I'm confused. What fees are you talking about? You know, the security deposit, and the first and last month's rent.
Oh, I got it. I thought you were talking about something else. Just send me a check for $3,500. That's the deposit of $1,000, plus $2,500 for rent.
Just give me your address, and I'll mail the check today. You can send it to 3035 E. Foothill Blvd., Pasadena, CA 91107.
So, when can I start packing? When can I move in? Your rent will start on the first, so move in then. Stop by here for your keys.
Very good! Now all I need is your phone number. Call my office anytime at 626-555-3000.
Yes, I'm John Smith. What can I do for you?  Hi, John. This is Terry Evans here. Do you want some good news?
Sure, let me have it. The apartment owner likes you. He approved your rental application.
Wow, that's fantastic! I don't know what to say. Now you can't move in, of course, until you've paid some fees.
Fees, I don't remember anything about fees. Fees, like the first and last month's rent, and the security deposit.
Oh, yes, of course, those fees! You can send me a check for the total--$2,500 plus $1,000 equals a total of $3,500.
All I need is your address, and the check will be in the mail pronto. My address is 3035 E. Foothill Blvd., Pasadena, CA 91107.
Okay, got it. Now when will he let me move in? Move in when your rent starts, on the first. But get your keys from me first.
Okay, give me your phone number, please. You can always reach me, or leave a message, at 626-555-3000.
I would like to make an appointment for a project meeting. Of course, I have Monday or Tuesday available. What day would be best for you?
I would like to meet on Monday. Very well then. Are mornings or afternoons best?
I want to come in the morning. I will have my assistant check my calendar and get back to you with the exact time. Can you bring me an outline of the project when you come?
Yes, I can bring the outline when I come to the meeting. Do you think that we should include the entire committee in the meeting or just our sub-committee?
I think that we should have just the sub-committee. OK then, I will make the arrangements for them to attend. Do you know how to get there?
No, I need directions, please. Fine, we will make sure that we send you all of the information that you need. See you there!
Could I meet with you to discuss the project? Good idea. We could meet on Monday or Tuesday. Which day would you prefer?
Tuesday would be good for me. OK. Do you think we should meet in the morning or in the afternoon?
I think the afternoon would be best. That will work out. I will e-mail the exact time tomorrow. I need you to bring your plans with you.
Yes, I will bring my plans with me to the meeting. Should we invite the whole committee or should we just have the sub-committee there?
I feel that the whole committee needs to be there. Yes, I agree. We'll make sure that they get notified. Can you find the meeting place?
Yes, I know how to get there on my own. Great! We will send you all the details later. Looking forward to meeting with you!
When could we meet to discuss the project? I will be available on Monday or Tuesday. Choose which day is best for you.
I prefer Monday. Good. Can you come in the morning or would afternoon be best?
Either one is OK. Great! When I check with the others, I will send you an exact time. When you come, be prepared to do your presentation.
I will be prepared to do my presentation. Who would you like to see there? Just the sub-committee or should we ask the whole committee?
Everyone needs to be there. That will probably be best. Do you need help with directions?
I think I know where it is. Maybe you could send me directions just to make sure. OK. We will e-mail you all the information you need tomorrow. Have a good day!
I was wondering if I could borrow the company van for a fundraiser this weekend. Sure, I think that would be possible. Where is the fundraiser?
It is in the park downtown. Would you need it for both Saturday and Sunday?
We will need it for Saturday only. I think that would be OK. Who will be driving it?
Mary and I will be driving the van. Could you drop it off on Sunday night?
Yes, we can do that. Can we borrow the chairs from the lunchroom also? Yes, that would be fine. Just make sure that everything is returned by Sunday night.
Our unit is participating in a fundraiser this weekend and would like to borrow the van, if possible. I would need to check on that. Where is the fundraiser?
It will be at the beach by the pier. What day will you need it for?
We will only be needing it for Sunday. Maybe that could work. I need to know who will be driving it.
The only two drivers will be Mary and I. If I give you the keys to the garage, could you bring it back on Sunday evening?
Sure. We also would like to use the chairs from the lunchroom. Would that be OK? OK, but make sure that everything is back by Sunday night at the latest.
Could we borrow the company van for a fundraiser this weekend? That would be a possibility. Where is this fundraiser taking place?
It is in the hotel ballroom down the street. Do you need it for the whole weekend?
We will need it for both days. We will need to know who will be driving the van.
The van will be driven by Mary and me. It needs to be back on Sunday night. Can you arrange for that?
Yes, no problem. Would you mind if we borrowed a few of the chairs from the lunchroom? Just keep track of everything and get it all back where you took it from by Sunday evening.
I can't seem to find the cereal aisle. You'll find the cereal by the breakfast foods.
What breakfast foods? They're over by the oatmeal and the breakfast bars.
I think I know what you're talking about. Can I help you with anything else?
Could you tell me where the dishwashing detergent is? You'll find that by the paper towels.
I didn't think of that. That's where it'll be.
Thank you very much. If you need anything else, please feel free to ask me.
Could you tell me where the cereal is? If you go to the breakfast aisle, you'll find the cereal there.
What aisle is that? You'll find it by the oatmeal and breakfast bars.
I know where that is at. Is there anything else you need help finding?
Could you point me toward the dishwashing detergent? That's over by the paper towels and toilet paper.
I didn't even think about that. That's where it is.
Thank you so much for helping me. Let me know if you need anything else.
I need to find the cereal aisle. The cereal is over by the breakfast foods.
Where is that at? It's by the oatmeal and breakfast bars.
I think I can find that. Did you need help finding anything else?
Actually, I do need to find the dishwashing detergent. That would be over by the paper towels and toilet paper.
I thought it was over there. Yeah, you'll find it there.
I'm having a problem. What's the problem?
A pipe burst in my wall. Is the pipe causing any water damage?
The water is causing mildew. I can come fix the pipe sometime tomorrow.
Can I just call someone myself to fix it? I don't think that would be a good idea.
You won't do it until tomorrow. I guess you have a point.
So, I can call someone to fix it? Go right ahead.
I have an issue. What's going on?
There is a leaking pipe in my wall. Is there any water damage?
There is mildew. I'll go to your apartment tomorrow to fix the pipe.
Why can't I call someone to fix it today? I'll just do it myself.
I need it done today. You're right about that.
Are you okay with me calling a plumber? That's fine.
There is a problem in my apartment. What is it?
A pipe broke in my wall, and water is leaking. Is the water causing any damage?
Yes, it's creating mildew on the walls. I won't be able to fix the pipe until tomorrow.
I can call a plumber to fix it right now. I'll do it for you.
You can't do it until tomorrow, and I need it fixed now. That's true.
You're okay with me calling someone? I'm all right with that.
I am having some big problems on this tour. What seems to be the problem? We are here to help you.
This tour company seems very disorganized. No one seems to have a clear picture as to where we are going and when we are going to get there. I will see what I can do about that. How about the accommodations on the tour?
So far, we have been staying in really out-of-the-way accommodations. Is anything wrong with your room?
The television in our room was broken, and they didn't send anyone to fix it. I will complain to the hotel manager about that. How about the hotel restaurant?
The food in the restaurant was terrible, and a few people from our group got sick. I am so sorry that you had such a bad experience. We would like to offer you a free city tour and lunch to make it up to you.
I paid good money for this tour and would appreciate some help with some problems that have come up. I would like to help you smooth out any difficulties you are having. What can I help you with?
This tour company can't seem to coordinate anything. We are always arriving after something is closed or get there when the guides for the site are on a break. We are trying to fix that. Are the accommodations to your liking?
Our accommodations are pretty substandard. Is there anything in particular that is wrong with your room?
The room smelled of smoke, even though it was supposed to be a nonsmoking room. You should not have to put up with that. Was the hotel restaurant good?
Actually a few people from our group got sick, and everyone thinks it was from the bad dinner that we ate. Our tour company takes pride in providing excellent tours. Please let me offer you a free city tour and lunch as an apology.
I would like to discuss some problems that I am having with this tour. I am sorry you are having a difficult time. What may I help you with?
This tour company doesn't seem to know the town very well. We are always getting lost! I am sorry that that has been the case. How would you rate your accommodations?
Our accommodations are not very pleasant. What don't you like about your room?
The room was very noisy, and we couldn't get to sleep. That is unacceptable. Did you at least enjoy your dinner in the hotel restaurant?
The food was horrible at the hotel restaurant, and a few of us got sick after eating there. I am glad that you told me about the problems. I would like you to be my guest for a free massage at the hotel spa tonight.
When can I move into my new house? The current owners will be moving out on Tuesday, so technically you could pick up the keys and move in on Wednesday.
Will the utilities be turned on? You need to contact the utility company and make arrangements to transfer the utilities to your name.
I really want to paint the walls right away and get the carpet cleaned. If I were you, I would take a few days to take care of those things before you move in.
I was thinking that I should have my new appliances delivered as we are moving in. That would be perfect. That way, someone will be there, but you will have them right away.
Can you help me on my move-in day? I think that I have something else really important to do on that day. I just can't remember what it is.
What would be a good day to finally move into the house? You can pick up your keys on Tuesday night. When you actually move in is up to you.
Will the electricity and water be on, or do we need to do something to get it turned on? Make sure that you transfer the utilities to your name and tell them when you will be moving in.
The carpet needs to be cleaned, and I want to paint the walls a different color. An empty house is easier to paint and clean. Take a few days to take care of those things before you start moving your furniture in.
I want my appliances to be delivered as we are moving into the house. I think that will work out just fine. It will help when you move your groceries in and need to keep them cold.
Would you be willing to help me do a few things on the day I move in? My grandmother needs me to help her trim her roses that day.
What would be the earliest that I could actually move into my new house? The keys will be turned in on Tuesday night. The house will be yours at that time.
What should we do to make sure that we have the electricity and water turned on? You can tell the utility company what day you are moving in, and they will transfer the utilities to your name.
There are a few things that we want to do to the place, like painting and carpet cleaning. Take advantage of the house being empty to clean and paint. It will be harder to do after the furniture and appliances have arrived.
I asked the store to deliver my new appliances on the day we are moving in. That will be good. You are going to want your stove and refrigerator right away.
I could use some help on moving day. What are you doing on Saturday? I think I am getting a fever and will be too sick to help you. Here, feel how hot my head is!
Are you going to vote? Yes, but not for the person you're voting for.
Why not? I don't like him.
What's wrong with him? He's not too smart.
That's not true. I don't agree with his policies, either.
I think he is a great candidate. I don't think so.
I think you should rethink your opinion about him. I have the right to my own opinion.
Will you be voting? I won't be voting for the same person as you.
Why? I really don't like your candidate.
What's your problem with him? I don't find him very smart.
He is smart. I also don't agree with his policies.
He's a fabulous candidate. That's just your opinion.
You shouldn't think poorly of him. I'm entitled to my opinion.
You're voting, right? Yes, I am, but I'm not voting for who you're voting for.
Why is that? I don't like that candidate.
Why don't you like him? I do not find him to be very intelligent.
He is very smart. He's not smart, and I don't agree with any of his policies.
I think he's the best candidate. But I don't see what you see.
You really shouldn't speak so negatively about him. I have my own opinion.
Excuse me for being late to work. Where have you been?
My car broke down. That's too bad. Please try to fix it so that it doesn't happen again.
Yes, I'll work on it. Thank you, have a seat. We are working on the new project 
Great! Fill me in. Let's take a look at the Campbell Project.
I don't understand the projected revenues. Let's take another look at it for those of you who don't understand.
I am sorry I am so late to work. What was the problem?
I lost track of time. Things happen make sure it doesn't become a habit.
It won't happen again. All right, please take this message and call this client.
No problem. Now does everyone understand the diagram on the board?
Yes, I understand the numbers. I will explain it again especially for those of you who arrived late.
I lost track of time, am I late? Yes. What kept you from arriving on time?
My friend needed me to help him. I realize that everyone has emergencies just get here on time from now on.
My apologies. I appreciate you saying that and would like you to join us in our meeting.
Sure, I'll sit right here. Wonderful, does anyone have any questions about this project?
I am confused about the projected revenues. I'm glad that some of you get it, but let's go over it once more.
How are you doing? Great. Thanks.
May I help you with something?  I would like to transfer some money.
Where would you like to transfer money from? Take it from my savings account.
Where would you like the money transferred? I want it transferred into my checking account.
How much would you like to transfer? I would like to transfer $200.
Will that be all today? That's it for today. Thank you.
How are you today? Very well.
Do you need help with something? I need to make a transfer.
What account would you like to transfer the money from? I want to transfer money from my savings account.
Where do you want the money to go to? I want the money to be transferred into my checking account.
How much money are you going to transfer today? $200 will be fine.
Is that all I can do for you today? I won't be needing anything else.
How's everything with you today? I'm fine. Thank you.
What can I do for you? I need to transfer money.
Do you know which account you want to take the money from? From my savings account.
Where are you transferring the money to? I would like it transferred to my checking account.
How much? I want to transfer $200.
Will that be all? Yes. That will be all.
I need your help with something. What's wrong?
I somehow locked myself out of my apartment. How did you lock yourself out?
I'm really not sure. Where's your key?
I locked it inside the house. I do have a spare key to your door.
May I use it, please? Okay, but once you get in, bring my key right back.
I will, and thank you so much. Make sure to keep your key with you next time.
Could you help me? What happened?
I'm locked out of my apartment. What did you do to lock yourself out?
I have no idea. You don't have your key?
It's inside of my apartment. I have a key to your apartment.
Could I borrow it for just a second? All right. Bring it back when you're done.
Great, thanks a lot. I hope you'll be more careful next time.
I really need you to do something for me. What's the problem?
I can't get into my apartment. How'd you manage that?
I don't know. Do you know where your key is?
It's inside my apartment. I have a spare key.
Will you let me use it to get inside? Sure. Remember to give it back when you're finished.
I appreciate this. No problem. Try not to lock yourself out again.
What's your favorite movie? My favorite movie is Superbad.
Oh, why is that? It's the funniest movie that I've ever seen.
That's true. It is a very funny movie. You've seen it before? 
Yes, I saw that movie the first day it came out in theaters. Didn't you laugh through the whole movie? I did.
Me too. That movie brought tears to my eyes. Mine too.
I have it on DVD at my house if you want to come over and watch it. Sure, let's go.
Which movie is your favorite to watch? I have to say, my favorite movie is Superbad.
Is that right? Why? Honestly, it is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time.
You're right. That movie is hilarious. I didn't think you saw that movie.
I went to see it the day it came out. I was laughing through the whole movie.
I couldn't help laughing, either.  Same here.
I bought the movie. Would you like to come to my house and watch it? Of course.
Out of every movie that you've seen, which one is your favorite? I'm going to have to say that Superbad is the best movie ever.
You think so, how come? Well, Superbad is super funny.
You're not lying, I found that movie absolutely hilarious. I didn't know that you saw Superbad before.
I made sure to be in line to see it the first day it came out. I couldn't keep from laughing throughout the whole movie.
I was laughing hysterically the whole time my stomach muscles hurt afterwards. That's exactly how I felt.
I got the movie when it came out on DVD, do you want to come over? I would love to.
I would like to order some internet today. What kind would you like?
What kind of internet is there? You can get DSL or dial-up.
Which of those two is best? I would recommend DSL.
Is that one better? It's better because it doesn't tie up your phone.
What do you mean by that? DSL isn't connected through your phone line, but dial-up is.
So then I can't use my phone if I'm on the internet? That's correct. With DSL you can do both.
I need to get internet. Which kind of internet connection do you want to get?
What kind can I get? There is dial-up or DSL.
Which one do you feel is best? I would get DSL if I were you.
DSL is better than dial-up? It's the best choice plus, it won't tie up your phone line.
I'm not sure what that means. Dial-up is connected through your phone, unlike DSL.
That'll make it impossible for me to use. Exactly. With DSL you don't have that problem.
I'd like to have internet on my computer. Do you know what kind of internet you would like to get?
What are my options? You can either get dial-up or DSL.
Which one would you recommend? DSL is the best choice.
Why is DSL better? It's a lot better because it doesn't tie up your phone line.
What exactly does that mean? Well, with dial-up your internet is connected by your phone line.
That means that I can't use my phone and the internet at the same time, right? That's right. You won't have that problem with DSL.
Do you have the notes from last week's class? Did you come late?
I couldn't make it. Why is that?
I was sick. Oh, okay. Well, here you go.
Are these all of them? Oh, wait, here are the rest.
Thanks a bunch. Don't mention it.
Do you mind if I borrow the notes from last week? Were you here last week?
I was unable to make it. How come?
I was sick that day, and couldn't make it. Well, here are the notes.
Are there any more? Sorry, here you go.
Thanks a lot. No problem.
Let me get last week's notes. Yeah, sure--you didn't come to class that day?
I couldn't come. Why not?
I wasn't feeling well. Here they are.
Thanks a lot are these all the notes? Oh, no, this is the rest.
Thank you very much. It's no problem at all.
I'm returning your phone call. I'm glad that you could get back to me so fast.
No problem, but what were you calling about? I needed to talk to you about your son.
Is he messing up in school? He was acting up in class one day last week.
What was he doing? He wouldn't stop talking throughout the class.
I don't know what's gotten into him. If you could, would you please talk to him?
I will get right on that, and I am very sorry. I really appreciate your help.
Did you call me? Thank you for returning my call.
What was your call about? I wanted to have a talk with you about your son.
What did he do? He was messing around last week in class.
Exactly what did he do? Even though I asked him not to, he kept speaking out in class.
I don't know what his problem is. I need you to talk to him, if you don't mind.
That won't happen again, I'm sorry. Thank you. Hopefully I won't have to call about him again.
I believe that you called me? Oh, hi. Thanks for getting back to me quickly.
Why did you call me? I was calling about your son.
Did he do something wrong? Your son was acting up in class.
What do you mean? He was talking and causing a disturbance during class.
That's really not like him. If you could just talk to him, I would greatly appreciate it.
I apologize, and I'll make sure he doesn't do that again. Don't worry about it, but thank you very much.
I am really interested in buying this television. That's great!
How much are you selling it for? This t.v is $2500.
You can't be serious. That's how much this t.v costs.
That's too expensive for me. This television is of very high quality.
You can't go down on the price. By how much?
I'll buy it for $2000. I'm sorry, but the price is final.
I would love to buy this TV. Fantastic!
What's the price for it? This television is on sale for $2500.
Seriously? That's the price.
That's way too much money. That is actually very enexpensive for this television. 
Could you lower the price some? How much are you talking?
$2000 is as high as I'll go. I'm very sorry, but $2500 is the final price.
I want to purchase this television. I'm glad to hear that.
How much does it cost? I'm selling it for $2500.
That can't be right. That's the going price for that particular TV.
I can't afford that. This is a very high quality television.
I would buy it if the price was lowered. How much lower?
How about you sell it to me for $2000? $2500 is a low as I'll go.
I was wondering if you could help me book a few tours. You have come to the right place. How many days will you be visiting here?
I will be here for a week. Have you ever visited our city before?
This is my first time visiting this city. What are you interested in? Do you enjoy museums and buildings, or would you rather hit some outdoor hotspots and venues?
I really enjoy visiting museums and art galleries. We have tours for all interests.
Do you have a city tour? Yes, in fact, I usually suggest that to visitors.
I need help knowing how to book some tours. We will be able to book your tours here. How long will you be here?
I am only staying for three days. Is this your first stay in our city?
I have been here before on a business trip but didn't really have a chance to see much. Have you thought of what types of things you would like to see? Would you maybe like to visit some outdoor venues or nighttime hotspots?
I love being outdoors and would love to spend some time at the beach. We have a tour that can take you where you can see all of that.
Do you have a tour where I can get a quick overview of the city? We do have tours like that, and I think that that is a good place to start.
I need help figuring out what to see and visit in this city. We are definitely the place to come to when booking tours. What is the length of your stay here?
I am on a layover and will only have today and tomorrow morning to sightsee. How familiar are you with our city?
Actually I was born here but haven't been here in twenty years. Do you have any ideas of what you would like to see? Perhaps you would enjoy our world-renowned museums or a visit to our magnificent zoological gardens.
I was interested in checking out local architecture. I think that you would enjoy a number of our tours.
Is there any way that I can take a quick tour of the city, so that I can get some idea as to what I might like to see? A general city tour is an excellent tour to start with.
I need to get some beef. Do you know what kind of beef you want?
I want to get some ground beef. How many pounds do you need?
I would like four pounds of ground beef. What kind of ground beef do you need?
I would like the extra lean. Let me go and get that for you.
Thank you very much. No problem.
I'll wrap it up for you now. I appreciate that.
I would like to buy some beef. What kind do you want?
I need to get ground beef. How many pounds would you like me to get you?
I need about four pounds. Exactly what type of ground beef do you want?
Extra lean. I'll get that for you right now.
I appreciate that. Don't mention it.
I'll just wrap this up for you. Thanks for your help.
Could I get some beef? What kind of beef would you like to get?
Ground beef would be fine. How many pounds would you like?
Four pounds is enough. What kind of ground beef do you want?
I'm going to need extra lean ground beef. I can get that for you.
Thanks so much. You're welcome.
Let me go wrap the ground beef up for you. Thanks for everything.
What should I do when I find a job? There are a few considerations. Is this a part-time or full-time job?
Does it make a difference? Basically, you really don't need to do much of anything. On the Continued Claim Form, you will note that you now have a new job and also note what you are earning.
If I get work for a few weeks, will I be terminated from EDD? You will not mess up your job benefits by taking work. You can always come back and notify EDD that you are once again in need of assistance.
Should I tell EDD that I have found a job? Is this a temporary job or something more permanent?
What difference does it make? When you get your next Continued Claim Form, you should just write down where you worked and note that you no longer need unemployment.
If I take a short job and then get laid off, will I be starting over trying to get unemployment? Just because you work for a week doesn't mean that you will be losing your benefits.
How do I know when to tell EDD that have I started a new job? Work is work, whether it's a part-time or temporary job or a full-time gig.
So I guess I have to report that I've found a little bit of work. All you need to do is fill in the blanks correctly on the Continued Claim Form, and the EDD Office will take care of the rest.
What about if I find a job that I know will only last for a couple of weeks? Can I take it? It is to your advantage to work as much as you can.
I guess that we won't be going rollerblading today with all this rain! Yes, rollerblading in six inches of water would not be fun. What would you like to do instead?
I think that maybe we could check out the local mall, grab some lunch, and maybe see a movie. Yes, that sounds like a relaxing way to check out the local culture and still stay dry.
What else could we do in bad weather? You know, we could take a double-decker bus tour of famous haunted houses and buildings.
That would be fun, and the rain would only add to the atmosphere. There is an old English pub next door. Maybe when we finish with the haunted house, we can duck in there for some brew.
What a great idea! If we are lucky, maybe they'll have some great food at the pub for supper.
This rain sort of blows our chances of going rollerblading! No, I don't think that we will be able to do what we planned to do. What can we do for fun today?
There is a large indoor mall just down the street with an incredible ice rink we could check out. We could stay inside and dry, and still get out of this hotel room for a while.
I am trying to think of something else that we could do in bad weather. We could sign up for that double-decker bus tour of haunted houses.
The rainy day would only add to the haunted house atmosphere. I think that when we are done with our haunted house touring, we should pop into the English pub next door for a beer.
I could go for that! I hope that we can get some nice hot food for dinner at the pub.
I think that rollerblading today is kind of not happening in this rainstorm. We definitely need to come up with a different plan to amuse ourselves. What do you think would be fun?
There is a large indoor mall hooked onto the Modern Art Museum just down the street. That would allow us to stay dry and still get a feel for the local culture.
I wonder what the locals do in bad weather. There is a sign for a double-decker tour of haunted houses in the lobby.
Haunted houses would be a perfect outing for a rainy day! I think we should wrap up our rainy haunted house day with some ale at the English pub down the street.
I think that rainy days and pubs go together! Usually pubs have some pretty good cold-weather food. Maybe we can have dinner there.

My appointment was on Tuesday. What time was it scheduled for?
It was for two o'clock in the afternoon. I see your appointment. What day would you like to switch to?

I'm having problems with my computer. What's wrong with it?
For some reason it won't turn on. Have you checked the connections on your computer?
What connections? There are cords that connect your computer to a power outlet.
Will the cords keep it from turning on? It won't turn on if the cords aren't connected.
I didn't think of that. Try it and see if it works.
I think that I will, thanks. It should work, but let me know if it doesn't.
My computer isn't working. Tell me what the problem is.
I'm trying to turn it on, but it won't work. Try checking the connections.
Which ones are you referring to? The cords that you see behind your CPU that plug into an outlet.
Is that why it won't turn on? If they're not connected right, that will keep it from turning on.
I did not know that. You should check the connections.
I'm going to do that. Tell me if it's still not working.
Something's wrong with my computer. What's the problem?
My computer won't turn on. Did you see if all the connections are right?
I'm not sure I understand what you mean. The connections between your CPU and your outlet.
Is that what's stopping my computer from turning on? If your plugs aren't connected all the way, the computer won't turn on.
I had no idea. Why don't you try it and see what happens?
I'll try it right now. Let me know if that doesn't work.
I'd like to talk to you about my grades. Sure! What exactly do you have questions about?
I am worried that I messed up on a test. Well, let me take a look at my grade book. How do YOU think you are doing?
I think I am doing great, except for that one test! Well, your scores show that you could do a little better. What do you think you could improve on?
I think that I could study a little harder for tests. Fine! Please remember that regular attendance is the most important way to begin.
Yes, I know. I'm sure you'll do fine.
Could you talk to me for a few minutes about my grades? Step into my office for a moment. What is your concern?
Am I failing? Let's go on the computer to see what's up. Do you think you are doing well?
I am pretty sure that I am in trouble. I can see that you are trying, but where do you think you could improve?
I missed a few classes I need to make sure I come to school on a regular basis. Having a regular study routine and following it is very important, right?
I'll try it's hard! Thanks for stopping by!
Professor, I'm concerned about my grades. Do you have a minute? Of course, how can I help you?
I want to know if I am doing OK. Let's pull out your scores so far. Do you think you are doing OK?
I am afraid that I might not be doing all that well. I'm seeing that you are doing OK in some areas, but not so well in others.
I think I could take better notes and read a little more. You can greatly improve your grades by always reflecting on what you can improve on.
I'm working on it! Just do your best and I am sure that you will see improvement.
I need a doctor immediately! Sir, is everything all right?
My wife just collapsed on the floor! Sir, I need you to calm down. Take deep breaths.
I'm sorry. It's just that my wife. I need the emergency room. Sir, I'm dialing 911 on another line.
What's taking you so long? I'm transferring you right now. Just remain calm.
Help me! I need a doctor! What is the problem, sir?
My wife is on the floor! Sir, please calm down. Take a deep breath.
I need some help, right now! Sir, I'm going to put you through to 911.
Hurry, please! I'm transferring you right now, sir.
I need a doctor right now! Tell me the problem, sir.
My wife just passed out! Sir, it's difficult to understand you. Please take a deep breath and calm down.
Don't tell me to calm down! My wife is passed out! I'm getting 911 on another line, sir.
Okay, but hurry. Stay calm, sir, and talk clearly.
Get a doctor here, immediately! What's the problem, sir?
My wife is on the floor, she's unconscious! Sir, could you calm down a little bit, please?
Calm down?! My wife is unconscious, and you're telling me to calm down?! Hold on just a second, sir. I'm dialing 911.
Hurry up, please. I'm connecting you now, sir.
A doctor! I need a doctor!  Give me some details, sir.
Something is wrong with my wife. She's lying on the floor. Sir, if you don't calm down, you might have a stroke yourself. 
You're right, I'm beside myself with worry. Hold on, sir. I'm connecting you with 911.
Time is critical. Hurry up! I hope everything turns out well, sir. Here's 911.
Did you enjoy your meal? Yes, we really enjoyed it.
May I interest you in some dessert? Yes, that sounds great.
We have chocolate mousse cake, and a spicy rum apple crisp for our specials. The apple crisp sounds great.
Since there are four of you, would you like to split a second dessert? Good suggestion. Could you please bring us a chocolate mousse cake and four dessert forks, please?
Would you like coffee or tea with your dessert? Let's have four coffees, please.
OK. I will be right back with your desserts and drinks. Thank you! We have really enjoyed our meal here.
So how was your meal? Our meal was wonderful!
Would you like to finish your evening with us with some dessert? I am full, but maybe we could split a few desserts.
Tonight's dessert specials include chocolate mousse cake, and a spicy rum apple crisp. I would love the apple crisp.

Can I bring you some coffee or tea with your dessert? We would like two coffees and two teas.
I will put your dessert order in and be right back with your drinks. Thanks, and may we have our check when you come back? We have theater tickets and need to leave soon.
Did your meal meet with your approval? Our meal was absolutely perfect!
How about a dessert to top off that wonderful meal? Dessert sounds perfect, but I would like to split something with my friends.
On this evening's dessert list, we have chocolate mousse cake, and a spicy rum apple crisp. I think that the apple crisp would be wonderful.
One dessert will serve two, so would you like to split a second one? We would also like a piece of chocolate mousse cake. Could you bring us four dessert forks, please?
How about some coffee and tea with your dessert? We are all tea drinkers. Please bring us four teas.
I will prepare your desserts and have someone bring you your drinks right away. The hot drinks first would be great. Thanks!
Professor, excuse me, but I need to leave early. What seems to be the problem?
I am not feeling well.  What is bothering you?
I think I am beginning to have an asthma attack. Would you like someone to walk you over to the Student Health Center?
No, I think that I should just go home because I have some medicine there. Do you need a ride home?
I live in the dorms across the street, so I'll be OK. OK, then, hope you feel better soon. Check your e-mail for missed assignments.
Excuse me, professor. I need to go home now. Is everything OK?
I just feel funny. What exactly seems to be the matter?
I have a terrible headache. Do you think that you should go to the Student Health Center?
I already have some medicine at home if I could just get there. Do you need someone to drive you home?
Thank you, but the bus stops right at my house. Well, go home and rest up. Make sure you check the website for your assignments.
I am sorry, but I cannot stay for the rest of class today. Why do you need to leave early?
I don't feel so good. What doesn't feel right?
I feel as if I am going to be sick to my stomach. Perhaps you should get checked out at the Student Health Center before you go home.
I have some medicine at home that I could take. Are you going to be OK to drive home, or would you like someone to go with you?
Thank you, but my friend is in the library, and he can give me a ride home. We hope that you are feeling better soon. E-mail me if you have any questions.
Are you going to vote? I am so excited to be voting.
Do you know who you're going to vote for? I am so impressed with the candidate I'm going to vote for.
What's so great about him? I feel that he is very intelligent.
Oh, really? Yes, and I agree with all his policies.
That's good to hear. I think this man is going to be the next President.

Hopefully, he will be. I can't wait to vote.
Sorry to bother you, but I was wondering if you could drive me to the emergency room. Of course. What is the problem?
I am running a really high fever of 105 degrees, and I have a rash on my stomach. If you can, go and unlock the back door, so I can get in when I get there if you fall asleep.
I can do that when I get off of the phone. Do you know where your driver's license and insurance card are?
I already had them out before I called you. Where is your nearest emergency room?
It's just a few blocks away. Fine, I am on my way. I'll be there in about five minutes.
I hate to call you this late at night, but could you possibly help me get to the emergency room? We will come right over. What happened?
My temperature went up to 105, and I have a rash! Make sure that someone unlocks the back door, so I can get in if you fall asleep before I get there.
I will do that in a minute. Make sure that you have your insurance card and driver's license where we can grab them.
I know right where they both are. Is there an emergency room near you?
It is on the other side of town, next to city hall. I am on my way. Give me ten minutes and I'll get to you.
I really need your help and want to know if you could drive me to the emergency room. I will take you there right away. What is wrong?
I woke up with a rash and a temperature of 105! I want to be able to get to you when I get there. If you can unlock the back door right now, that would be great.
I will make sure that I do that before you get here. Also, make sure that we have your driver's license and insurance card before we leave for the emergency room.
I am getting them out while I am speaking to you. Do you know where your nearest emergency room is?
It is near the bridge that crosses over the river. I am driving to you even as we speak. Hang in there!

I'd like to order a restock on my minibar. You finished everything in there, sir?
Absolutely everything.  What would you like to order?
Three bottles each of Perrier and Jim Beam. Uh-huh. What else do you want?
The apples were great. Could you bring a couple more up? No problem. Is there anything else I can get for you?
Some grape juice would also be nice. I'll get all of that for you right away. Someone should be up shortly.
I need my minibar restocked. Everything is gone, sir?
There's not a drop left of anything. Is there anything in particular you'd like?
Yes, the Perrier and the Jim Beam hit the spot. Let me have three more of each. Got it. Anything else?
I really liked the apples. Bring me a couple of apples, please. Not a problem. Anything else?
Yes, one more thing: some grape juice. Someone will be up shortly with your order, sir.
My minibar is empty. You already finished off everything, sir?
I finished off everything. Would you like anything in particular?
The Perrier and the Jim Beam. Let me have three more of each. Beam and Perrier. Anything else, sir?
I really loved the apples in my room. Bring me a few more, please. Sure thing. Might there by anything else?
Yes, speaking of fruit, bring me some grape juice, too. Perrier, Jim Beam, apples, and grape juice. It will all be there shortly, sir.
How do I restock my minibar? You've drunk everything, sir?
I finished it all. Do you want the whole minibar, or just certain items?
Send me up three bottles each of Perrier and Jim Beam. That's three Jim Beams and three Perriers. Anything else, sir?
The apples in my room were delicious. Bring me a few more, please. Okay. Are you sure there isn't anything else?
You know, some grape juice would be really nice, too. Be patient for just a few minutes, sir, and someone will be at your door.
My minibar is completely empty. Everything in that minibar has been consumed, sir?
Everything's gone.  Is there anything special you'd like?
Just bring me three bottles each of Jim Beam and Perrier. Okay, sir. Three of each. Would you like anything else?
The fruit basket was great. I need a few more apples, please. Perrier, Jim Beam, and apples. Is that it for now?
Yes, one last thing: I could use some grape juice. Your order will be brought to you momentarily, sir.
I'm moving out. Your lease isn't up yet.
I won't be able to stay here anymore. That's going to be a problem.
I don't know why there's a problem. It's a problem because I can't give you your deposit back.
Why can't you give it back to me? You're breaking our contract.
I'm going to need my deposit back. That's not going to happen.
I can't stay here, though. That's really not my problem.
I have to move. You have not fulfilled your lease agreement yet.
I can't stay here anymore. There's a problem with that.
What is the problem? I won't be able to give you back your deposit.
Why not? This was stated in our agreement.
But I need it back. I can't do it.
It will be impossible for me to stay here. That's not my fault.
I'm going to be moving out soon. You still have time on your lease.
There's no way that I can stay here. That's not going to be all right.
I don't understand why. I'm going to have to keep your deposit
Why can't I have it back? Because you're leaving before your lease is over. 
You have to give it back to me. You're not going to get it.
But I'm not able to live here anymore. I can't help you with that.
It's great to be home! Did you have a nice trip?
It had its surprises, but when all was said and done, it was a good trip. What was your favorite part?
I loved our full moon beach party. What were the people like? Were they friendly?
The people were basically quite friendly. Did you bring me anything?
I brought you a lovely souvenir that I will be giving you for your birthday next week. I can't wait until I get to be the one to go on vacation.
I love traveling, but I love coming home, too! Did you enjoy your vacation?
It had its ups and downs, but I really enjoyed it. What did you like the best?
I absolutely enjoyed the kayak trip we took to an outlying island. Did you enjoy the people there? Did they like you?
Most of the people seemed happy that we were there, but some of them really resented visitors. What did you bring back for me?
I did get you something, and I will give to you as soon as I unpack. Next time, I am going to save up my money and go with you.
How nice it is to be home again with all of my family! Did your journey turn out as well as you had hoped it would?
All trips have good and bad points, but this one had mostly good ones. Did you have something you enjoyed the most?
My favorite thing was the amazing food. Were the people receptive to having visitors?
ricans. Did you get me a souvenir?
Of course I brought you something! Next time I am going to be the one to go away, and you can stay home and feed the dog!

When would you like it to be delivered? I would like it delivered tomorrow.
What time would you like it delivered? It would like it delivered at noon.
That's fine. So, that won't be a problem?
We'll have it to you at 12pm tomorrow. That's great. I'll see you tomorrow then.
How are you doing today? Great. Thanks for asking.
Would you like our assistance with a move? Yes, actually I would.
What would you like us to move for you? I need you to move my furniture.
Could you tell me what kind of residence that we will be picking the furniture up from? The furniture is in my apartment.
Where will we be moving it to? You'll be taking it to the house I just bought.
All right. I just need both addresses, and we will take care of the moving for you. Excellent. Thank you very much.
How are you? I am doing well.
Did you need us to move something for you? That's exactly what I'm calling about.
What exactly do you need moved? All my furniture needs to be moved.
Where will we be moving your furniture from?  I need it moved from my apartment.
Where would you like us to move the furniture to? I need the furniture moved to my new house.
All I need is a little more information, and we'll take care of the rest. Sounds great. I'm glad you could help me.
How are you doing? I'm fine, thank you.
Did you need our help with a move? Yes, I do need your help with a move.
What can we move for you? I need all my furniture moved.
Will we be picking the furniture up from an apartment or a house? You'll be taking it from my old apartment.
Are we moving the furniture to a house or an apartment? To my new house.
We can do the move for you, but first I'm going to need some more information. Thanks a lot. I'll give you all the information you need.
I'd like to order broadband internet for my laptop. Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer, and a prompt will tell you the payment options. 
I don't have an Ethernet port. My computer runs entirely on wireless service. That's too bad. But there are several alternatives, if you want to hear them.
Yes, please! Tell me about the alternatives. We run a fully equipped computer lab on the first floor.
Very good. How much does that cost? The service is free to hotel patrons. However, printing costs ten cents per page.
I see. And the other alternatives? Alternatively, we do offer wireless in our lobby. You can bring your laptop down here.
Great! What if I need to print something in the lobby? You would have to use the computer lab. I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
I need broadband for my computer. No problem. Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer, and you're good to go.
That's a problem. My laptop has no Ethernet port, it's wireless only. Hmm. Well, we have some alternatives, if you're interested.
Go ahead. I'm all ears. We have a computer lab on the first floor.
That's great! How much is it? It's absolutely free to guests. Except for printing, of course.
What about the other alternatives? You could use your wireless right here in our lobby.
Yes, that's the ticket! And if I need to print something there? Well, we don't have a printer in the lobby yet. You'll have to use the lab.
I'd like to get busy on my computer, but I need some broadband. There's an Ethernet cable in your room. Just plug it into the back of your laptop.
I can't use Ethernet. My computer is wireless only. That's okay. I can tell you about some alternatives we have.
Any alternative that works will be great. Well, there's our computer lab on the first floor.
That sounds good. What's the charge? The lab and the computers are no charge, but you have to pay for whatever you print.
That sounds good. Now, how about the other alternatives? Of course. Our lobby is set up for wireless, so just bring your computer down here.
Use my laptop in the lobby? That's great! Now, if I need to print something there? They plan to install a printer here. But until then, you'll have to use the lab.
I can't get going on my computer until I get a broadband hookup. Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer, and you'll be off and running.
That would be okay if I had an Ethernet port. Unfortunately, my laptop uses wireless only. In that case, let me tell you about some alternatives.
Anything to get me up and running. For starters, we have a computer lab.
Fantastic! What do I have to pay per hour? The lab is completely free. But you do have to pay a dime a page for printing.
That's fine. Now tell me about the other alternatives. Just bring your laptop down here to the lobby. We're set up for wireless right here.
Great! I like that suggestion, but what if I need to print something there? Unfortunately, you'll have to go to the computer lab for your printing needs.
How do I get online with my laptop? Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer, and you'll be online in a heartbeat. 
I see the cable. But my computer runs on wireless only. No problem. I'll tell you about our alternatives.
Yes, I'd love to hear what the alternatives are.  Our state-of-the-art computer lab is on the first floor.
Great! But is it free? Sir, the computers are free to guests, but you do have to pay a nominal printing fee.
You said there were other alternatives? Just use your computer here in the lobby. It's set up for wireless.
That sounds like a winner. Now if I need to print something in the lobby? We might have a printer here next month. But for now, you'll have to go to the lab.
Whoa, look at all those ice cream choices! Yes, that is a lot of choices. What is your favorite?
I love anything with chocolate the best. I like chocolate myself.
Is there any kind of ice cream you don't like? I really don't like any ice cream with nuts in it.
I haven't ever cared for that myself. Have you ever had garlic ice cream?
That sounds absolutely disgusting! It was. Let's stick with the regular choices today, though.
There are so many flavors of ice cream to choose from! Yes, there must be about a hundred. Do you have a favorite?
I love fruit flavored ices the best. Yes, fresh fruit flavored is the best ever.
What is your least favorite ice cream? I don't like peppermint ice cream.
Yes, I know what you mean. One time, I tried garlic ice cream.
That could be interesting. That doesn't sound like a good choice for today. Let's order!
I have never seen so many flavors of ice cream in one place! There certainly are a lot. Can you choose a favorite?
Vanilla with toppings is my favorite. Is there anything as good as a hot fudge sundae?
No way! I don't like ice cream with too many different flavors in it.
I agree with that, it just doesn't work for me. I saw garlic ice cream on the menu once.
I think that that would be horrible! I think I'll stick with a more traditional choice today!
Could you help me make a plane reservation? I would be happy to help you. Where do you plan on going?
I am going to go to Hawaii. For that destination, you may leave from Los Angeles or Burbank Airport. Which would you prefer?
I think that I would rather leave from Los Angeles Airport. Would you prefer a morning or afternoon departure?
I need to leave in the morning. Fine. On your return flight, do you have a preference as to morning or afternoon?
I would prefer to return in the afternoon. I have booked you on your flight at a great rate. Here are your tickets.
I need to make a plane reservation. That is what I am here for. What is your destination?
I will be traveling to Aspen, Colorado. Would you prefer to leave from Los Angeles or Burbank Airport?
Burbank Airport would be best for me. You can leave in the morning of afternoon from that airport. Do you have a preference?
I can only take a flight that leaves in the afternoon. I can book that for you right now. When you return, would you prefer morning or afternoon?
I think that I would like a morning return flight better. I was able to book your flight, and I will print your tickets right now. Have a great trip!
I am planning a trip and need help making my airline reservation. Sure. Where are you traveling to on your trip?
I will be vacationing in Oregon. You have an option of departing from Los Angeles or Burbank Airport. What is your preference?
I live closer to Los Angeles Airport, so that would be the best choice. Does it matter to you if you leave in the morning or afternoon?
I can leave at either time. I'll put you on a morning flight. Is a morning or afternoon return flight preferable for you?
Either morning or afternoon would work for me. I'll give you an afternoon flight. Here are your tickets.
I need help planning my vacation. Sure, where would you like to go?
I haven't decided where to go yet. Do you enjoy warm or cold climates?
I am thinking that I might enjoy a tropical climate. I have some brochures here that you might like to look at.
These look great! Do you know how much you want to spend on this vacation?
I have about a thousand dollars to spend on this trip. Well, take these brochures, and get back to me when you want to make your reservations.
Could you help me with vacation plans? Do you know where you will be traveling?
I am open to suggestions at this point. Are you wanting to travel to a tropical climate, or would you like to go somewhere with a cooler climate?
I would like to travel to a cooler destination. I can give you some brochures that could give you some ideas.
I will look at them right now. How much money is in your budget for this trip?
I think that I can spend about two hundred dollars a day. Take your time choosing a destination and, when you've narrowed it down, I'll be happy to help you make a reservation.
I was wondering if you would be able to help me with vacation plans. Have you chosen your destination?
I don't know where I want to go yet. Do you enjoy warm weather, or are you looking forward to a cooler vacation?
A nice temperate climate would be best for me. Why don't you take a look at these brochures that might help you make up your mind?
This place looks nice. Have you thought about what you would like to spend on this vacation?
I just got a bonus and can spend about three thousand dollars total. I'll be happy to help you make a reservation whenever you decide upon a destination.
Can you help me plan the office party? Sure. What do you need the most help with, the food or entertainment?
I need help with food. OK, well, let's coordinate our efforts. Should this party be formal or casual?
I think it should be casual. I agree. Next, we have to decide on food. We have a choice of Chinese or Continental Cuisine. Which one should we have?
I would prefer Chinese food for this party. Perfect choice. For music, should we have a live band or a DJ?
I think we should hire a live band. OK then. Well, I will work on my part and get back to you with my progress on Friday.
I need help with the office party. Yes, of course. We could split it. What part would you like to do, the food or the entertainment?
I have no idea what the entertainment should be. Let's make sure we are on the same page. Do we want a formal or informal gathering?
Let's make it a formal affair. Yes, that would be best. Now, for food should we have Chinese or American food?
American food would be the best choice. That would be great. What kind of music would you like, a band or recorded music?
We should bring in a really good DJ. That works for me. Let's see what we can each do about planning our part and meet again on Friday.
Would you help me figure out what to do about the office party? I would be happy to help. What would you like me to help with, food or entertainment?
I would like to help you with both. That will work out fine. To make sure everything goes together, do you think this party should be casual or dressy?
A dressy party would be fun! That will work out fine. Do you think that Chinese or Continental food would be best?
We should probably have both. Yes, that will work out fine. Should we hire a band or bring in a DJ?
Maybe we could do both! Everything sounds great then! I'll meet you back here on Friday to discuss the details.
I'd like to return this radio. All right. Do you have the receipt?
Here it is. May I ask why you're returning the radio?
It does not work very well. Would you like to exchange it?
No. I'd just like a refund. Certainly. This will take only a few seconds.
I want to return this radio. Okay. May I see your receipt?
Certainly. I have it right here. What is the problem with the radio?
It has poor reception. Perhaps you'd like a different one?
No, thank you. A refund is all I want. Okay. Give me a few seconds, please.
I need to return this radio. That won't be a problem, as long as you have your receipt.
Here you go. What's the problem?
It doesn't pick up my favorite station. I can exchange it for you.
Thanks, but I just want a refund. A refund it will be. Do you have the original box?
I'm returning this radio. No problem. You do have your receipt, don't you?
Here you are. What seems to be the problem?
It doesn't have a headphone jack. If you'd like, I can show you a different one.
No, thanks. A refund will be just fine. No problem. This'll only take a minute.
I don't want to keep this radio. No problem. Let me see your receipt, please.
Of course. I always keep my receipts. Is there a problem with the radio?
Something is rattling around inside it. Would you like a different model?
No. Just give me a refund, please. Okay, a refund will be no problem.
Hey, I got this parking ticket can you help me figure a way out of it? First of all, did you park somewhere too long or in the wrong spot?
I was there too long. Was the area clearly labeled with the time limit and all?
Yeah, I saw it. You will need to convince the judge that you couldn't see the signs.
Yeah, I understand. Whatever you do, you need to be respectful and polite to the judge.
Yeah, you're right. Just try to talk to him about how IF you made a mistake that it won't happen again.
OK, I will. Good luck!
Man, I got another parking ticket. I am so unlucky--what can I do? Was your car where it wasn't supposed to be, or did you stay there too long?
I was in an area where I wasn't supposed to park. Could you tell where you were supposed to park and for how long?
I could tell what I was supposed to do. That's too bad. That means that you can't use receipts or a witness to help you out. 
I guess not. Try brown-nosing the judge, but don't be too obvious about it.
Sure, if it will help. Try and convince him that something was labeled wrong or something.
Sounds good! Give it your best shot it might work.
I don't know how to fight a parking ticket. Did you get written up for exceeding the time limit or for parking where you weren't supposed to be?
Both. Did you see all the signs and just decide to blow them off?
I was confused. Maybe you could explain that you are new and got confused--could you do that?
If it might work, I'll go for it! Let the judge see that you are only a poor starving student who won't do it again.
I can see how that might work. Without actually saying that the parking ticket guy was an idiot, make it seem as though it was HIS mistake, not yours!
I could do that! Try it. It just might save you the price of a parking ticket.
I would like to purchase some health insurance.  Have you ever purchased health insurance before?
I have health insurance now, but I want to look into other choices. Do you know if you are interested in an HMO or a PPO?
Could you explain the difference to me? To clarify it for you, with a PPO you pay more but you get to choose your own doctor.
When I pay for a service, is the payment the same for a PPO or HMO? The payments are quite a bit higher for the PPO, but you can go anywhere you like. 
How much will an HMO cost me per month? Go to our website and fill in the questionnaire. Once we have all of your information, we can give you a quote.
I am calling to purchase health insurance. Do you have health insurance now?
I was on my parents' policy, but I need to start buying my own. You can purchase an HMO or a PPO. Do you know what you want?
I don't know what I want. Let me explain it to you. An HMO is a little cheaper, but you can only choose certain doctors.
When I go to the doctor, do I pay the same out-of-pocket expenses for a PPO? The payments are a little lower for an HMO as long as you go to their doctors.
How much will a PPO cost me per month? We need to factor in many things. Why don't you come in, and we will have you fill out a questionnaire.
I need information on purchasing health insurance. Is this the first time you have had health insurance?
This is my first time buying health insurance. You have a choice of HMO or PPO. Do you understand the difference?
I am not sure what those are. Just so you understand completely: An HMO is a little cheaper, but you have limited choices of which doctor you choose.
If I need to use my insurance, are the payments the same for a PPO and HMO? By going to the providers on the HMO list, you save money in out-of-pocket expenses.
Can you give me a comparison between a PPO and an HMO? We can mail you a questionnaire and when we have all of your information, we will mail you a quote.
I was wondering if you could go over the services available at EDD to help me get a job. The best opportunity is called CalJOBS, which is an Internet-based job placement service that you can make use of.

It's time for bed. I'm not ready to go to sleep. I'm not tired.
It's quite late, and you have an early day tomorrow. I'm not going to be able to fall asleep.
Why don't you try counting sheep? I've tried that before. It really doesn't work.
That's beside the point, you still need to go to bed. Why can't I just stay up until I fall asleep?
If I let you do that, then you're just going to be up all night. I promise I'll go to sleep soon.
No, you're going to sleep now, so good night. See you in the morning.
Shouldn't you already be in bed? I can't sleep. I'm really not all that tired.
You need to get some rest, as you have to get up early in the morning. It's impossible for me to get to sleep right now.
Just close your eyes, and try not to think. That really does not work for me.
It doesn't matter, you need to get some sleep. How about I tire myself out, and then fall asleep when I'm tired?
Then you're not going to go to sleep. Don't worry, I'll make sure and get to sleep in a little while.
I want you in bed, right now, so sweet dreams. Fine. Sleep well yourself.
Isn't it past your bedtime already? I am not sleepy. 
It's getting late, and you have to wake up early tomorrow. There is no way that I can fall asleep right now.
Try listening to some soft music. It won't work. I'm nowhere close to being tired.
I really don't care, just go to sleep. What if I stay up and do something, until I get tired?
You'll be up all night if I let you do that. I'm going to get to sleep eventually.
You need to go to sleep now, so go to sleep. Good night.
I want to try something different today. What do you mean?
I want a different hair style. What style do you want?
Can you make my hair short? Exactly how short do you want it?
Make it a few inches long. Are you sure you want me to cut it that short?
I've been thinking about this for a while now. Okay. I'll do it if you're positive that this is what you want.
I honestly want my hair that short. All right, then let's begin.
Let's do something different today. Like how?
I would like you to give me a different hair style. What did you have in mind?
Give me a short haircut. Do you know how short you want your hair to be?
I want you to cut it to a few inches long. That's pretty short. Are you sure about this?
I've had this idea for some time now. I'm going to do it, but you have to be sure you really want me to.
This is what I want. Fine then. Let's get started.
I really want to switch things up. What were you thinking?
I think I want to try a new style. What would you like me to do?
I want you to cut my hair shorter. How short?
I want my hair to be only a few inches long. Do you really want it that short?
Yes, I've been wanting it short for a while now. If you really want me to, then I'll do it.
I'm absolutely sure that this is what I want. Let's do it.
Professor, I am going to need to leave class early today. What is the problem?
I need to go to the airport to pick up a relative. Are you planning on having someone take notes for you?
Yes, I've got that part covered. When, exactly do you need to leave?
I don't need to leave until the very end of class. Fine, but next time try and not have to miss class again.
Thanks, Professor. See you later! See you later! Drive carefully.
Excuse me, Professor, I have a problem and need to leave class early. Why do you have to leave early?
I am not feeling well. Could you make it up by attending my other section this week?
Yes, it's all taken care of. Are you leaving right away or can you stay for a few more minutes?
I can stay a few more minutes. OK, but please make sure that you get all of your make-up work completed.
Thanks, Professor. I've got it covered! Go do what you have to do, but make sure it doesn't happen again.
I am sorry, but I can't stay until the end of class. Where do you need to be that is more important than school?
I have an appointment. Do you have a plan to make up your missed work?
No, but I'll make sure someone helps me out this week with my missed work. Are you going to go right away?
I am leaving right now. All right, but please remember that it is your responsibility to catch up.
Thanks, Professor. I'll make sure everything gets taken care of. Goodbye, and try not to miss any more school.
I really need help knowing what to do about transferring the deed of my house. The work of legally transferring the deed of your house will be taken care of in escrow.
What is the first thing that they will do? The first thing they do is a title search to make sure that there are no liens against your property.
What if I have a lien against my property? Your home cannot be sold until you clear all liens.
How long will the escrow take? You can control some aspects of the length of your escrow but not all. Complete all paperwork in a timely fashion.
So, how many days will it take? An escrow can take anywhere from thirty to ninety days.
I know nothing about transferring the deed of my home. The escrow company will be doing all of the work in transferring your deed.
What is the first step in transferring the deed? A deed transfer always includes a title search to make sure that there are no outstanding liens against the property.
What if they discover a lien against my property? A title transfer cannot occur until you clear all liens.
Will my escrow take long? To move your escrow along, it is important to supply all documents that are requested in a timely fashion.
What is the length of the average escrow? The average escrow will last anywhere from thirty to ninety days.
I think that I am going to hire a lawyer to help me transfer the deed of my house. Don't worry. The escrow company will be helping us with transferring the deed.
How do they begin the process of transferring the deed? A title search is necessary to make sure that there are no liens against your property.
What will happen if they find a lien against my property? All liens against the property must be cleared before the sale of your house can continue.
How can I shorten my escrow? Make sure that you accurately complete all paperwork in a timely fashion. This will help shorten the length of your escrow.
How many days will it take to close the escrow? Thirty to ninety days is about how long it takes to complete an escrow.
Are you going to vote? Yes, are you?
Yes, but what day are the elections? You don't know what day the elections are?
That's why I'm asking you. They're this coming Tuesday.
Really? Yes, I'm serious.
Good thing you told me. I can't believe you didn't know when the elections were.
It slipped my mind. You should watch the news more often.
Will you be voting? I will. Will you be voting?
When is the election? You don't know that?
I just don't know. It's this Tuesday.
You can't be serious. Why would I joke?
Thanks for telling me. You should've known already.
I forgot. As long as you go vote, that's all that matters.
Are you going to vote? Of course! Are you?
I plan to, but what day is the election? You should know that.
Can you just tell me? The election is this Tuesday.
Are you serious? I'm not kidding.
It's a good thing I asked you. That should've been something you knew already.
I couldn't remember. Whatever. Just make sure you go vote.
I am calling about my cable service. What's the problem?
For the past week my cable hasn't been working. I apologize, but the cable has been down lately.
Do you know when it is going to start working again? Give it a couple days, and it should be back on.
Will I still have to pay for the cable while it's not working? Since it's not working, I'm going to give you a credit.
So I don't have to pay anything? You won't pay anything until your cable starts working again.
Okay, thank you very much for your help. No problem. Thank you for being so understanding.
I have a question about my cable. What do you need?
I haven't been able to watch my cable for the past week. Right now the cable isn't working.
Could you tell me when it will be back on? The cable should be running again in a couple of days.

Are you almost finished with my hair? I'm almost finished.
How much longer is it going to be? I'm done now. Do you like it?
I absolutely love it. You really like it?
Yes, I truly do. I'm glad you like it.
How much do I owe you? It's going to be $55.
Here you go, thanks for everything. Make sure and come back in a couple of weeks.
Will you be done doing my hair soon? Give me a little while longer.

There's a problem with my credit card. Tell me what the problem is.
A charge came up on my bill that I didn't make. What was the charge for?
The charge was for a $350 purse, but I did not buy it. Are you sure that you didn't make that purchase?
I would know if I bought something that expensive. I apologize. What day was this purchase made?
It was bought on November 12th at 3:15 pm, while I was at work. All right, we'll do an investigation.
Until this investigation is finished, will I have to pay for the charge? No, you don't. We'll take care of it.
I have a problem with my credit card. What's wrong with it?
There is a charge on my card that I didn't make. Can you tell me what the charge was?

I think I would remember if I made a purchase that large. Sorry. When was this purse purchased?
It was purchased on the 12th of November at 3:15 pm, but I was at work. We'll do an investigation and get to the bottom of this.
In the meantime, do I have to pay for this charge? No. We'll take care of everything.
Can you tell me where we are supposed to take our trash? Put it in the dumpster next to that stairway.
What day do they pick the trash up? They empty the trash every Wednesday.
Are we supposed to mix our recyclables in, or sort them? We are supposed to sort our recyclables.
Is there a special container for recyclables? You should have a blue container in your kitchen. Empty that into the blue bin downstairs.
What about plant material? Anything that can be composted goes into the bin with the green lid.
I need a little help about where to dump my trash bags. Put them in the parking lot dumpster near the parking spaces.
When is trash day? Trash day is Wednesday.
Do they sort our recyclables, or do we do it? They expect us to take out our recyclables.
Do we put our recyclables in a separate bin? Just take all of your recyclables to the blue bin downstairs.
Is there a special bin for yard waste? All material to be composted goes into the bin with the green lid.
Where are the dumpsters located in this building? Right now they are in the front of the building for pickup.
When do the dumpsters get emptied? They usually get emptied Wednesday, unless there is a holiday in there somewhere.
Are there separate containers for recyclables? We don't mix our recyclables with regular trash.
What does the container for recyclables look like? All of your recyclables go into the blue bin.
How about composting materials? We have a great composting program that uses the bin with the green lid.
Excuse me, but is this dress on sale? The dress was on sale yesterday.
Are you sure? I'd be happy to pay the sale price today. I'm so sorry, but rules are rules.
I'll just check out a few other stores. I'm sorry I couldn't help you.
Pardon me. Is this dress on sale? Actually, the sale ended yesterday.
You know, it's only one day later. How about giving me the sale price? I'm sorry, but I can't change the price that's in the computer.
Let me think about it. Maybe I'll wait until the next sale. Take a look around. Maybe you'll see something else you like.
Is this dress on sale? It was on sale-yesterday.
Still, couldn't you sell it to me today at the sale price? I'm sorry, but I'd lose my job if I sold it to you at yesterday's sale price.
I had my heart set on buying this dress. Well, feel free to browse. We have other items on sale today.
Am I right in thinking that this dress is on sale? I'm sorry. You're one day too late for the sale.
Couldn't you still sell it today at the sale price? I'm sorry. One day can make a big difference sometimes.
No problem. Other stores are having sales. I'll check them out. Before you go, let me show you some other dresses that are on sale.
Am I mistaken, or is this dress on sale? I'm very sorry. The sale ended yesterday.
I really like this dress, but I want to pay the sale price. If you like, I can put you on our mailing list for the next sale.
That's okay. Some days you win, some days you lose. Let me ask my manager when he thinks this dress will be on sale again.
I am really not feeling very well. Do you think you need to go to a doctor?
I think that we should maybe check into how to find a doctor in this country. I don't know where to begin looking for a doctor here.
I think that we should call the front desk to see if they can help us. I have an American Express card. I heard that their travel services are quite good.
That sounds like a great idea! Do you have travel insurance?
Yes, I bought travel health insurance. I am going to call down to the office right now and see what they can do for us.
I haven't felt well since we ate dinner at that restaurant with the fish on the menu. Should I look into finding a doctor for you?
I feel bad enough that I am thinking about how we could find a doctor. How does someone find a physician in this country?
The front desk should be able to find a doctor on call for us. With my American Express card, we could probably get a good referral for a doctor.
Yes, the card should help us find a good doctor. Did you buy supplemental health insurance for travelers?
Yes, I am insured by a supplemental policy. I will call American Express right now, and we'll get you some medical advice.
I think I am running a fever, and my stomach hurts. Do you feel bad enough that we should call a doctor?
I don't want to wait till the last minute to try and locate a physician. Do you know how to find a doctor in this country?
The front desk would probably be our best source for a doctor. I am going to call the travel services number on my American Express card to get a referral.
I am sure that they could refer us to a good doctor. Are you insured by a traveler's insurance policy?
No, but I checked before I left, and my home health policy covers me here. I will call the insurance company and see what doctor they want us to use.
You don't look so good. I have a major stomachache
Did you eat something strange? I had spaghetti with clam sauce for lunch.
Maybe you have food poisoning. Yes, that could have been it, but I haven't been feeling that great for the past few days.
Are you under a lot of stress? Not really. Things have been going OK.
Maybe you have a touch of the flu. I think that I might be getting the flu.
Are you feeling OK? My stomach is bothering me.
What have you been eating? I had a ham sandwich with mayonnaise for lunch.
Maybe the food had something wrong with it. It could be bad food, but I didn't feel so well yesterday, either.
Have you been under a lot of pressure lately? I haven't been under any more stress than usual.
Perhaps you have caught that bug that is going around. I feel like maybe I am coming down with the flu.
You look kind of green. I don't feel so good. I am feeling sick to my stomach.
Have you had anything to eat lately? I had fried shrimp and clams for lunch.
Perhaps the food was bad. Perhaps, but I haven't felt well for a few days now.
Has anything been upsetting you lately? My stress level is pretty much what is usually is.
Do you think that maybe you are getting the flu? It seems to me like I may have caught a bug.
Hey there, how are you doing? I am great. How are you?
Well, I got laid off, and I'm looking for work. Yeah, me too! What are you thinking you would like to do?
Right now, I'll take about anything that will pay the mortgage. Have you gone out on any interviews so far?
I went out on one interview, but I haven't heard back from them. Did you see the posting for the electrician apprentice program?
You know, I saw that and it looks pretty good! Let's go check it out again!
How are things going with you? I am doing well. What's up with you?
Believe it or not, the company I worked for closed down, so I'm out of a job. The same with me. Have you given much thought to what you want to do next?
I am not being all that particular right now because I just need to keep a roof over my head. How about interviews? Have you been on any of those yet?
I wish that I could get the opportunity to be interviewed. How about the electrician program that they have listed over there?
I read about that, and the position sounded great! Let's go see how we can apply for those positions.
I haven't seen you in a while. How have you been? Things are going fairly well. How about you?
I'm hanging in there, but I lost my job and need to find another one quickly. I am looking for a job myself. What were you thinking of doing next?
I am just trying to find something that will pay the bills until this bad economy passes by. Have you gotten any interviews yet?
No, I haven't been out on one interview yet. Have you thought about the electrician program over there?
I think that I might be interested in that position. I think we should go over there and see if we can apply for that program.
Good morning, I am here for my interview. Hello, nice to meet you. I'm Mr. Gotcha. Have any trouble finding the place?
No problem. So why don't you tell me why you are interested in changing positions?
Unfortunately, our company is shutting down due to the economy. What would you consider your strengths?
I am probably best at researching for marketing purposes. What is your biggest weakness?
I tend to get bored easily and so love to keep myself challenged. We have a position where that could work out well.
Thank you for taking the time to interview me. Hi there, I'm Bill Gotcha, the owner of Gotcha Enterprises. Did you find your way here OK?
Your assistant gave wonderful directions. Why are you switching jobs at this point in your career?
Our company is moving overseas and I wish to stay in the United States. What are you best at?
I am good at organizing systems that have been having problems. What is your biggest challenge in terms of skills?
I don't like to sit around and so like to always find things to do to keep myself busy. That is good to hear!
Good afternoon. Thank you for the opportunity to interview for this position. Hello, have a seat. I'm Bill Gotcha. I am assuming you found your way here with no trouble?
Actually, I am very familiar with the area so there was absolutely no problem. I am curious as to why you want to leave your current employer.
I am interested in switching fields. Do you feel that you are exceptionally good at anything in particular?
I am good at pulling together teams of people to accomplish a task. What are you not good at?
I am impatient with myself at times and am hard on myself. We appreciate hearing that about you!

I really want to get something to eat. What are you going to get?
I don't know what I want to eat. Well, do you want burgers, Chinese food, or Mexican food?
Chinese food sounds good. Where are you going to get it from?
I haven't the slightest idea. I usually get my Chinese food from Panda Express.
You like Panda Express? The food there is actually pretty good.
Maybe I'll go there then. You should. I know you'll like it.
I think I'm going to go get some food. What do you want?

I wouldn't mind getting some Chinese food. Where are you going to get your Chinese food from?
I'm not sure. When I want Chinese food, I go to Panda Express.
Do they do a good job on the food? The food isn't bad there.

I really love this temple we are visiting. As you enter the temple, please remove your shoes as the others are doing.
It is so quiet here. Yes, they are showing respect to their gods. People come here to pray and meditate.
I noticed that the women all have some sort of head covering. It is a tradition that women cover their heads while in the temple.
I noticed that all of the people were eating with their hands at dinner last night. Yes, that is another custom that people practice here.
I have never traveled to a place that was so different from my home. Yes, this city has a fascinating and diverse past. It is thousands of years old!
This temple is beautiful! Please make sure that you remove your shoes before you enter the temple.
It is very quiet in here even though there are a lot of people in this area. Yes, even the children are expected to be respectful and quiet here. People need quiet to meditate.
The women all seem to have beautiful scarves or veils on their heads. Women in this society would not consider setting foot in a temple without their head being covered.
I noticed at dinner last night that people in this country like to use their bread to eat with instead of silverware. Yes, that bread is made of a special texture that works well for that.
This city is certainly very different from what I am used to at home. This is an amazing city. It is quite ancient with a diverse past!
What an amazing temple! See how everyone is removing their shoes before entering? We need to do the same.
The people in this room are very quiet. This is an area of peace and tranquility. It is expected that people keep their voices down out of respect for those who are meditating.
The women's scarves are quite beautiful. Women of this faith must have their heads covered to enter the temple.
Last night at dinner, I noticed that everyone was using bread to eat with instead of silverware. Yes, eating your curry or vegetables with your bread is a custom in this country.
Are you planning on voting? Yes. What about you?
Yes, but this will be my first time voting. Really?
Yes, and I have no idea how to do it. Voting is simple.
I don't know any of the laws they're trying to pass. That's okay. They describe everything on the ballot.
I didn't know that. Don't worry. You'll be fine.
That's good to know. Congratulations on your first voting day.
Are you going to vote? I am. Are you?
Yes, and for the first time. Is that right?
I don't know how to vote. Voting isn't difficult.
I'm not sure what laws are being voted on. They tell you everything on the ballot.
They do? You'll be okay.
Thanks for telling me. You should be excited about your first vote.
Will you be voting this year? Of course! Will you?
This is going to be my first time voting. Are you serious?
I'm not sure what I'm doing. Voting is easy.
I don't know anything about the bills or laws they're trying to pass. The ballot gives you all that information.
Nobody told me that before. You have nothing to worry about.
I'm so glad you told me that. Good luck on your first election.
Good morning, is this the Renter's Hotline? Yes, what can I help you with?
I have a question about discrimination in housing. What type of discrimination?
I think that he doesn't want to rent to me because of my race. What made you think that your race was a problem?
He seemed OK talking to me on the phone, but seemed to change his mind when he saw me in person. What else made you feel he was discriminating against you?
Well, he had a 25 unit apartment building and everyone I saw there was his same race. Racial discrimination is very hard to prove, but if you would like to come down, we can go over a checklist that can help you build a case.
I would like to speak with someone in the Housing Department. You have reached the right area. Can I help you with something?
I think that I may have experienced discrimination in trying to rent an apartment. Can you be specific as to what type of discrimination?
I felt that he didn't like me because I wasn't the same race that he was. How come you feel it was race that was the issue?
When I showed up on his doorstep, he seemed bothered by my appearance. Is there anything else that made you feel he was using race as a factor in who he rented to?
As I walked through the apartment building all I saw were people who were the same race as the manager. It is not easy to prove racial discrimination, but please go to our website which can help you file a formal complaint.
Hello, is this the Legal Advice Line? You are in the right department. What can I do for you?
I think that the landlord where I am trying to rent an apartment may be discriminating against me. Discrimination is a pretty broad term. What type, specifically?
I have a feeling that he will not consider my application because of my race. Are you sure that race was the issue? What makes you feel this way?
When he saw me in person, he seemed bothered by me although I seemed to be under consideration when I e-mailed him. Do you have any proof that he would not rent to you because of your race?
I didn't see one person in that whole building who wasn't the same race as the manager. It is difficult to prove racial discrimination, but you may file a formal complaint in our office.

These are called All Star Chuck Taylors. I really like those. How much did they cost?
They were about forty dollars. I think I'm going to go buy myself a pair.
I absolutely love what you're wearing today. You do? I just bought this outfit a couple days ago.
Seriously, it looks really nice on you. Where did you buy it from? I bought it from the Macy's at the Santa Anita mall.
I really like that outfit. Thanks. I think you look nice today, too.

I love your outfit right now. Well, I think you look nice today too.

I need a doctor's appointment right away! Is this an emergency?
I am having trouble breathing. Have you had a cold lately?
It has been going on for a few days now. You should hang up and dial 911.
I don't think that this is that bad, but I need to see a doctor right away.vd.?
Yes, I can get a ride to Urgent Care. Good. When you get there, a doctor will be able to see you right away.
I need to see a doctor soon! Do you feel this is an emergency?
My chest feels tight, and I can't catch my breath. Did this come on suddenly?

My family can bring me to Urgent Care. Come in right away, and they will see you as soon as possible.
Is this Professor Clark's office? This is Professor Clark speaking.
This is Kalia from your morning literature class. Yes, what can I do for you?
I had a skydiving accident over the weekend and won't be able to come to school today. My goodness! Are you OK?
I broke my leg, but it is healing. How long will you be out of class?
I should be able to return by next Monday. Fine. Well, thanks for calling and letting me know you will be absent. I hope you feel better soon.
Good morning, may I speak with Professor Clark, please? You are speaking with Professor Clark.
Professor, I am Kalia from your morning literature class. Yes, how can I help you?
I ran my car into a tree yesterday and need to miss a few days of school. Oh, my God! I hope you are all right.
I have a concussion, but I will be OK. How much school will you miss?
I only need to take this week off. I appreciate you calling and telling me that you won't be in class. See you next week!
Is this Professor Clark? Yes, I am Professor Clark.
Professor, this is Kalia, and I am in your literature class on Monday mornings. Yes, how are you doing?
I was partying hard over the weekend, fell down the stairs, and need time to recuperate. That sounds painful. Are you going to be OK?
I sprained my wrist, but the doctor says it will be fine. How many days will you be out of school?
The doctor said I should be good enough to return next week. I am glad you let me know that you will be missing class. Get well!
How much is the fare for this bus? It costs $1.25 to ride the bus.
So, how long have you been driving buses? I've been driving this bus for only a few months.
Do you enjoy being a bus driver? Not really.
I would never dream of driving a bus. I didn't either, but a paycheck's a paycheck.
It was nice talking to you. Nice talking to you too.
Have a good day. That'll be hard to do while driving the bus.
How much for the bus ride? It's $1.25 for this bus.
How long have you been a bus driver? I started driving the bus a few months ago.
Is it fun driving the bus? Not at all.
I don't think I ever wanted to be a bus driver. I never did either, but it pays the bills.
I enjoyed talking to you.  I liked talking to you too.
What does it cost to ride this bus? The fare is $1.25.
Have you been driving buses a long time? I haven't been driving for long-only for a few months.
Do you like to drive the bus? Not in the least bit.
I would have never dreamed of ever becoming a bus driver. I never dreamed of doing this either. The only thing I like about it is the money.
It was really fun chatting with you. It was really nice talking to you too.
Have a good one. I'll have a good day once this day is over.
I want to look at the souvenirs over at the souvenir stand. What do you need to buy?
I usually buy myself some jewelry or some clothing. I always buy a lot of things for my family. How about you?
Yes, they practically swarm me when I get home! What are some of their favorite gifts?
The teenagers like me to bring them tee shirts that you can't get anywhere else. This stuff is pretty expensive, isn't it?
Souvenirs cost a lot for what they are, but we can shop around for better prices. Let's go across the street and see what they have over there.
Let's stop and look at the souvenirs at the souvenir stand. What types of souvenirs were you looking for?
When I travel, I usually like to bring back a special necklace or clothing. I end up buying a lot of stuff for the kids in my family. Do you like to do that, too?
My family loves for me to take trips so they can get the goodies I bring them. What types of things do they like?
The little kids like little trinkets, like those little shell animals over there. I feel like this stuff is kind of overpriced.
Some souvenir stands charge more than others, so it pays to shop around. Why don't we try checking prices a little farther away from the tourist section?
We need to stop so I can shop for some souvenirs at the souvenir stand. Do you have anything in particular that you are looking for?
I love to go clothes-shopping when I travel or buy a new piece of jewelry. The kids in my family love getting souvenirs. How about the children in your family?
Everyone in my family enjoys getting treats from my travels! What do they like you to bring home?
My nieces love to get little jewelry boxes like those on the top shelf. Things seem to cost a lot at this stand.
You really need to shop around with souvenirs because they can vary a lot in price. We could walk a few more blocks away from the beach and see what the prices are like there.
Do you have any helpful hints for preparing to move out of my home? The first thing I would do is to make a list of what needs to be done. Then number the items as to what can be done ahead of time.
What kinds of things should be on my list? First would probably be to get rid of any extra things that you have by having a garage sale.
That is a good idea because I have way too much junk. You also should schedule your moving van in advance.
Can I begin packing things ahead of time? Yes, just keep in mind what you won't be using in the near future and pack those items first.
Should I schedule my utilities to be shut off? You need to work that out ahead of time with your utility companies and the new owners.
I was wondering if you had any useful suggestions for how to prepare for our moving day. Make a prioritized list of what needs to be done and when. Many things can be done ahead of time.
Can you give me some suggestions for my list? Many people have a garage sale to avoid moving things that they no longer use.
That would certainly cut down on the price of moving. Make sure that you take the time to schedule your moving van.
Would it be okay to get a head start on my packing? Begin by packing things that you don't frequently need. Save only a few things until right before your moving date.
When should I have my utilities shut off? It is best for you and the new owners to coordinate the transfer of the utilities and what needs to be turned off and on.
I want our moving day to go smoothly and am open to your suggestions. I would suggest that you make a list and check off the items as you go along. The list will get shorter as your moving date approaches.
What things do people usually put on their moving-out list? One thing that can be done ahead of time is to get rid of excess stuff by having a garage sale.
That would mean a lot less time wasted in packing up our things. List scheduling your moving van as an item on your to do list.
Do people ever start packing a month or so before moving? You can certainly start packing things that you won't be using right away.
I don't know if I should have my utilities shut off or leave them on for the people who are moving in. You could simply have all the utilities shut off on the day you move out, but you might want to coordinate that with the new owners.
What forms should I fill out to collect unemployment? You need to fill out a special form to apply for unemployment benefits.
Where do I get the application form for unemployment benefits? You can call the Employment Development Office and request a form.
What information will I need to provide to apply for unemployment? Be prepared to provide your employer's name and address and what dates you worked.
What else will the Employment Development Office need? You need to be prepared to show that your unemployment is not your fault. If you have a termination notice, that would be great.
What will happen next? The Employment Development Office will call you for an interview.

It's nice to meet you. I'm glad we're meeting today. Thank you.
You're welcome. I would like to talk to you about your daughter.
Is there a problem? No, your daughter is great.
That's great news. Your daughter is a wonderful student.
She isn't messing up in class? Of course not. Your daughter is smart and very well behaved.
I'm so glad to hear that she's doing well. It is my pleasure to have her in my class.
We finally get a chance to meet. Thank you for meeting me here.
It's no problem. I need to speak with you about your daughter.
Is there something wrong? I enjoy having your daughter in my class.
I'm glad to hear it. She is a great addition to my class.
You don't have anything bad to say about her? She is always behaving herself, and she's so smart.
I am so happy that she's doing okay. I'm more than happy having her in my class.
How are you? It's nice to meet you. Thanks for coming.
It's my pleasure. I wanted to meet with you to discuss your daughter.
Is she acting up in class? Not at all. She's a joy to have in my class.
Is she really? She is absolutely wonderful.
So she isn't causing you any problems? No. She is actually very intelligent and well behaved.
I'm glad to know that you like her. You have nothing to worry about with her.
It was nice talking to you. Why are you trying to rush me off the phone?
I really have to go. Why? I still wanted to talk to you.
I have things to do. Like what?
Don't be nosey. I'm not. I just want to know.
Well, it's really none of your business. That's harsh.
I'm sorry, but I have to go. Fine.
I've enjoyed conversing with you. Is there a reason why you're trying to get off the phone so fast?
I've got to go. I wasn't done talking to you.
I have to do some things, and besides, it's not polite to be nosey. I'm not being nosey. I'm just asking.
I really don't think it's any of your business. That's not nice.
I apologize, but I'm getting off the phone now. Okay.
I'll talk to you later. What's the rush?
I have to get off the phone now. I'm not ready to get off the phone with you.
There are other things I need to take care of. What is it that you need to do? 
Please don't be nosey. I'm not being nosey, it's just a question.
You don't need to worry about that. That was mean to say.
I am very sorry, but I must go. I guess.
Did you vote yesterday? I sure did!
What candidate did you vote for? I voted for Obama.
I'm shocked he actually won. I knew he would win.
How'd you know? He was the best candidate this year.
What about him being black? I guess America is finally maturing.
I think you have a point. I'm really happy.
Did you vote? Of course!
Who was your vote for President? My vote was for Barack Obama.
I didn't expect him to win. I had no doubt in my mind that he would win.
What made you think that? Nobody could compete with him.
I thought his race would have kept him from winning. Times are changing.
That's true. I support our new President 100%.
You voted, right? You know I did.
Who did you vote for? I voted for Obama, of course!
Can you believe that he actually won? I knew he would win.
I didn't think he would. He was the top candidate.
I figured people wouldn't vote for him because he's African American. That just goes to show that America is finally turning over a new leaf.
You're absolutely right. I'm excited that Barack Obama is our President.
I have a reservation. My name is John Sandals. May I see your ID, please, Mr. Sandals?

I thought American Express was accepted everywhere. Never mind. Here's my VISA. Thanks. You're in room 507, a big, nonsmoking room, with a queen bed. Is that okay, sir?
Yes, that's just fine. I'm happy to hear that. Here is your key. Just dial 0 if you need anything.
My name is John Sandals, and I've got a reservation. May I see some identification, sir, please?
Sure. Here you are. Thank you so much. Have you got a credit card, Mr. Sandals?

No American Express? Okay, here's my VISA. Thank you, sir. You'll be in room 507, nonsmoking, with a queen-size bed. Do you approve, sir?

That's okay, I've got plenty of cards. Here's my VISA. Okay. You're in room 507. It's a single queen-size bed, spacious, and nonsmoking. Is that suitable?
Yes, that's just what I wanted.  Here's your key, sir. If you need anything, just dial 0 on your room phone.
I need to request a wake-up call for tomorrow morning. What time do you want the call?
I need two calls, one at 7 and another at 7:15. We can certainly do that. Expect a call from us at 7:00, and then again at :15.
Actually, can I change the latter wake-up call to 7:30 am? I can certainly do that. Is there anything else?
I can't think of anything. If I do think of something, I'll be sure to call again. Okay. Good night, sir.
I need a wake-up call tomorrow morning. Of course. When would you like the call?
Actually, I need two calls, one at 7 and the other at 7:15. No problem. We'll give you both calls.
Do you know what, let's change the second call to 7:30. No problem. Anything else, sir?
Not at the moment, thank you. Let me know if you do need anything.
Can you give me a wake-up call tomorrow? Certainly. What time would you like us to call you?
I need two wake-up calls, if you don't mind, one at 7 and the other at 7:15. Not a problem. We'll call you tomorrow morning at 7, and again at 7:15.
On second thought, you'd better make that second call at 7:30 instead of :15. Said, and done. Will there be anything else?
No, that gets it for now, thank you. Well, give us a call if there's anything more we can help you with.
Tomorrow I'm going to need a wake-up call. Not a problem. What time shall we call you?
I always hit the snooze button, so give me two calls, one at 7 and another at 7:15. It'll be our pleasure. We'll call you at 7 and then at 7:15.
Oops, cancel that. Change the second call to 7:30, will you, please? No sooner said than done. Can I help you with anything else?
No, that's about it for now. Okay, sir. Have a pleasant evening.
I need a wake-up call tomorrow. What time would you like your wake-up call?
I need two calls, one at 7 and another at 7:15. That is no problem at all, of course. You'll get a call at 7:00, and another at 7:15.
Then again, I think 7:15 is too early. Change 7:15 to 7:30, please. So, that'll be a call at 7 and another at 7:30. Do you have any other requests?
Not just now, but if I do think of something later, I'll give you a ring. Okay, sir. Sleep well.
I've got to get up early tomorrow, so please give me a wake-up call. Of course. We can give you a call anytime you like.
Actually, I need two calls, one at 7 and the other at 7:15. Your wish is our command. Expect a call at 7, and another one at 7:15. 
Wait a minute! I don't like 7:15, now that I think about it. Change it to :30. The second call is now changed to 7:30. Is there anything else we can help you with?
Nothing that I can think of right now. If something comes up, though, I'll call you. We're here all night long if you need anything.
Thanks for coming to see me today. It's no problem. I was really missing you anyway.
I missed you too. Why haven't you tried to come see me then?
I've been really busy. Doing what?
Working. I would've come to see you sooner, but I've been busy too.
What have you been doing? I've been working too.
Well regardless, I'm very happy that you came to see me. I am too.
I'm really glad that you came to see me. I had to. I was missing you a lot.
I was missing you too. So, why haven't you visited me?
I've actually been busy lately. What have you been doing?
I've just been working really hard. I've also been busy.
Tell me what you've been doing. Basically, I've been working too.
Well whatever, I'm glad you came. So am I.
I'm really happy that you came to visit me. I really missed you a lot.
I've been missing you like crazy. I don't understand why you haven't come to visit me.
Lately, I've been quite busy. Tell me what you've been up to.
I've really been working a lot lately. I've been pretty busy myself.
So what have you been up to? I've just been working a lot.
Whatever the reason may be, I'm glad you visited me. I'm glad I did too.
I need somebody to come over and fix my internet. What's wrong with it?
For some reason it's just not connecting. How long have you been having this problem?
It hasn't been working the past few days. Does the internet come up at all?
It does, but it won't connect to anything. Well, the internet isn't down, so there must be something wrong with your connection.
Could you send someone to fix it today? I'll send somebody over right away to fix it.
When will they be here? They should be there in the next hour.
I need to get my internet fixed. What's the problem with your internet?
It won't connect. How long has this been happening?
This problem has been happening for a few days now. The internet doesn't come up at all?
It just won't connect to a webpage, but it will pop up. There's obviously a problem with your connection.
I'm going to need someone to come and fix it for me. I can send somebody right now to fix it.
How long will it take for them to get here? They'll be there in about an hour.
Can you send someone to fix my internet? Are you having a problem with it?
My internet is having problems connecting. Can you tell me how long your internet has been messing up?
I've been having this problem for the last few days. Will the internet even pop up?
It'll pop up, but it won't connect to a webpage. Since the internet isn't broken, your connection must be messed up.
Do you think you can send somebody over to fix it? If you'd like, I can send someone to fix it right now.
How long will it be till they get here? It should be no longer than an hour.
Could you tell me if you have ever taken a class from Dr. Miller? Yes. Are you going to be taking a class from him?
Yes, but I have never taken his class before. He is very interesting and challenging. Is that what you are looking for?
Yes, that's what I need. He is really clear on what you need to learn to get a good grade. Are you willing to study hard?
Yes, I guess so. What I really liked about him is that he was an understanding and friendly teacher. Do you enjoy that in a teacher?
Yes, I had a teacher like that before. Did you know that he has 20 years teaching experience?
No, I didn't, but that could be a good thing. Well, take a look at everything and figure out what is best for you. Good luck!
Do you know anything about Dr. Miller's classes? Yes. Are you in his class?
I'm thinking of taking his class next semester. He really knew his stuff, but he graded hard. Would that be OK?
Yes, I really need someone who is really good. I didn't find it overwhelming to earn a good grade if you work at it. Can you do that?
Maybe, but I'm not sure. Man, this guy was so funny when he was teaching. I like that, don't you?
No, that stuff isn't important to me. Did you know that he is a fairly new teacher and very current in his field?
I don't care about any of that. We all are looking for different things in an instructor. I hope I've helped you.
Would you talk to me about taking one of Dr. Miller's classes? Yes. Have you ever been in one of his classes?
I'm thinking about taking his class next semester. He was a very easy teacher. Are you thinking of taking a class with him?
I'm not sure because I really need to learn something, but I also worry about grades. Grades are important, but don't you think that gaining the knowledge is important, too?
I really need to learn this stuff. He made everything so interesting that the time just flew by. Do you know what I mean?
Yes, that sounds right for me. Did you know that he came here last year after 10 years in the military?
Yeah, I already knew that. That could be a good thing. I think you know that you have to make the best decision for you. Enjoy your year!
I was wondering how you are going to calculate our final grades. Grades are based on many things: homework, attendance, quizzes, mid-term, and final.
What counts the most? Actually I look at all of it and let's not forget class participation.
Do you grade on a curve or use percentages? Homework, attendance, and quizzes are sixty percent the mid-term and final are worth twenty percent each.
What if we miss something? I will allow one unexcused absence after that you need to contact me ahead of time.
Will you tell us if we are failing during the year? You will be able to track your progress during the year.
What do you base our grades on? All of your coursework is important, including everything from attendance and homework to all of your test results for the semester.
Does the final count the most? All of it is important please just do your best at all times.
How do you total our scores? The final and mid-term are twenty percent each homework, attendance, and quizzes are the rest.
What if we are out sick? Make sure you contact me as I only allow one unexcused absence.
How can we know if we are doing OK during the year? Your grade will not be a surprise you will know what you need to work on.
How do you decide what grade we get? I look at many things: attendance, quizzes, and tests.
What is the most important factor? Obviously I look for improvement as we go along, but I would like you to do your best from the beginning.
How can we keep track of our grades? The final and midterm are 40 percent of your grade homework, attendance, and quizzes total 60 percent.
What if we can't get to school? You can only miss one class without penalty.
If we have a major problem, will you let us know? I will be letting you know during the year if you have a major problem.
Man, I'm so hungry! Can you buy me a burrito? I don't have any money to buy you a burrito.
Please? I haven't eaten anything all day. Look, I only have money to buy myself a burrito.
I'm so hungry, I could eat a whole cow! If you're so hungry, why don't you ask someone else for money?
I get paid on Friday, I'll pay you back then. Well, I guess on Friday, then you can eat.
That's pretty messed up. Why don't you just go home and eat?
I don't want to go all the way home just to eat. Well, I guess you're out of luck.
I really want a burrito! Can you get me one? I haven't got any money to purchase a burrito for you and me.
Would you please buy me one since I haven't eaten today? I only have a few dollars.
I could eat a horse right now, I'm so hungry. I want to eat too. Ask someone else to feed you.
Since I get my check this Friday, I can give you your money back then. So then, this Friday you'll be able to eat.
You're mean to say that. You should just go home and make yourself a sandwich or something.
My house is too far, and I'm really hungry. It sounds as if you're going to continue starving.
I'm starving! It would be truly appreciated if you bought me a burrito. I'm a little short. I don't have enough for you.
I'm starving, as I didn't eat yet today. I really don't have enough money.
My stomach feels so empty. Well, why don't you ask Bob for some money? I'm hungry too.
I'll be getting money on Friday, and I'll get it back to you then. Okay, so on Friday, you can buy yourself something to eat.
That's not nice.  You can always go home and make something to eat.
I can't go home yet, because I have things to do here. Sorry. That's not my fault.
Excuse me. Can you help me? Certainly. What can I do for you?
May I exchanged an opened DVD? Certainly, as long as you have your receipt.
Here you are. I'm sorry, but you're only allowed to return items within 30 days.
Is there any way I can exchange it? I'm afraid not.
I am not coming here anymore. I'm sorry, but please don't blame me.
Pardon me. May I ask you a question? Of course. How can I help you?
I opened this DVD. Can I still return it? No problem. May I have your receipt?
Here you go. Oh, it looks like you bought this more than 30 days ago.
Can't you bend the rules just a little bit? I'm sorry.
You just lost yourself another customer. Don't get mad at me, please. I don't make the rules.
Can you help me, please? No problem. What is your question?
Is it possible to return an opened DVD? Sure, as long as you have your receipt.
Here you go. I'm sorry. You can't return something you bought more than 30 days ago.
Yes, but this is only day 32. Isn't that okay? I'm sorry, but rules are rules.
Well, this is ridiculous. I won't shop here anymore. Well, if I was the boss, the rules might be different.
Can you give me a little help, please? That's what I'm here for.
Can I return this DVD even though I already opened it? That won't be a problem if you have your receipt.
It's right here in my wallet. Oh, the date on the receipt says that you bought it too long ago to return it.
But aren't there any exceptions? If I make an exception for you, I have to do it for everyone.
How do you expect to keep loyal customers? I wish I could help you, but I didn't make the rules.
Would you help me, please? It would be my pleasure.
I want to return this opened DVD. Is that possible? No problem at all. Do you have your receipt?
Let me dig it out of my wallet. I'm sorry. You can't return something more than 30 days old.
There must be some way around this. I'm sorry, but I have to tell everyone the same thing-no.
That's the dumbest rule I ever heard of. Maybe the rules will change if we lose all our customers.
I would like to make an offer on this house, but I don't know much about the process. As your realtor, I am here to take care of this process. How much were you planning on offering?
I really like the house and will pay the full asking price of three hundred and fifty thousand dollars. We want to leave ourselves some bargaining room. Let's offer three hundred and twenty thousand dollars.
That sounds good, but I don't want this house to get away from me. The market is fairly down right now, so the offer is a realistic one.
When will we know if they accept the offer? The owners usually respond to an offer within a few days.
Should I be contacting my bank in the meantime? You are already pre-qualified for your loan, so you are in good shape.
I have never bought a house before and don't know how to make an offer. The process of actually making the offer is something that I will take care of for you. What price were you considering offering?
I love this house and would be willing to pay the full asking price of three hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Let's leave some room on this offer. I think that three hundred and twenty thousand dollars is a fair offer in this housing market.
We could try that, but I really want this house! It is common practice to offer and then have a counter-offer.
How long will it take to find out if they are going to accept the offer? The sellers are usually fairly quick to respond. They want to get things moving.
Should I tell my bank that I have made an offer? There really isn't anything else to do right now except wait. You are already pre-qualified for your loan.
I have never done this before and don't know where to begin as far as making an offer on this house. Leave the details of making the offer up to me. What were you thinking you should offer?
I absolutely must have this house and will pay three hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more. It is best to start a little low on the first bid to allow for a counter-offer. How about offering three hundred and twenty thousand dollars?
I hope that the owners aren't insulted by that offer. Your offering price is not out-of-line. The owners will either take it or make a counter-offer.
Does it usually take very long for the owners to get back to you with an acceptance? It usually doesn't take very long for owners to respond to an offer. 
Should I be in touch with my bank to tell them to get the loan papers ready? The only thing you should do now is relax. You already are pre-qualified for your loan.
I haven't traveled much and need to know what I can carry in my luggage. There are different considerations. You have to consider airline rules and rules for customs.
How do I find out about each country's Customs regulations? You can go to a website for the particular country you are interested in.
Is there anything that I should keep in mind for all countries? Do not ever lie about what you are carrying in your luggage. If you get caught, there is a major fine just for lying.
How about regulations for what you can carry on an airline? The Internet is a good source for special regulations for particular airports and airlines.
I heard that I can't bring my own bottled water on the plane. You can buy water at the airport once you pass luggage inspection.
What can I carry in my luggage when I travel on an airline trip? When you fly, you need to think about what you can carry onboard and what you can take into a particular country.
Where can I go to find out about Customs regulations? Just Google the country you are interested in with these keywords: Customs and restrictions.
Are there any general rules for all countries? Always answer all questions accurately. If you get caught omitting anything, you will be fined and possibly detained.
What about airline regulations for the contents of your luggage? If you go to a website for a particular airport or airline, you can get specific information.
Is it true that I can't even bring my own water with me? You can bring an empty bottle with you if you like and fill it up once you pass inspection.
How can I find out what I can carry in my luggage on an airline flight? You have to think about Customs regulations and airline regulations.
What is the best place to get information about the Customs regulations for a country? It is easier to go online, but if you can't do that, you can write the Customs Office for the country you are interested in.
What is the most important thing I should keep in mind as far as Customs is concerned? Always be honest in declaring everything you are carrying. Otherwise, you can be fined for not declaring everything.
How do you find out what you can carry in your luggage for a particular airline? You can always call the airline you are flying, and they can give you specific information.
Can I at least bring my own bottled water with me? You can't bring your own water. You must buy it at the airport.
May I speak to you for a few minutes? About what?
I want to speak to you about this year's election. Oh, really?
Yes, I am a volunteer for the campaign. I am very impressed.
I feel that history is about to be made, and I want to be a part of it. That is very nice of you.
Will you be voting? Yes, I am going to vote.
Make sure you make it to your polling place early on Election Day. Thank you and good luck.
Could I speak to you for a minute? What do you want to speak to me about?
I want to talk about this year's election. Oh, you do?
I am volunteering for the campaign. What made you decide to volunteer?
I want to be a part of history. Good for you.
Do you plan on voting? I will be voting.
You should try and make it early to your polling place. Thanks for letting me know.
I would like to speak to you, if you don't mind. What would you like to speak to me about?
I would like to talk to you about this year's election. Is that right?
I am a volunteer for this year's campaign. That's wonderful. I am impressed at someone so young taking a stand.
I know history is about to be made, and I would like to be a part of it. That's fantastic.
Are you planning on voting? I'm going to vote.
Go to your polling place early on Election Day. I will. Good luck with your volunteering.
Ashley, what a great dinner party! Thank you, Joe. What would you like to drink with your meal? I can offer you wine, mango juice, or water.
Just water would be fine. Excellent choice. Can I dish you up some chicken?
Yes, the chicken looks wonderful! How about some salad to go with your chicken?
Sure, I love salad! Would you like to have rice with your chicken?
Yes, I think that rice will go perfectly with my chicken! Good! Julie, if you could pass this plate down to Joe, I think we are all set.
What a wonderful dinner you've prepared, Ashley! Thanks, Joe. Would you like some wine, mango juice, or water to go with your dinner?
I think that a glass of wine would be perfect. Here is your beverage. If you pass me your plate, I can dish you up some chicken.
Yes, the chicken smells great! Can I interest you in some salad to go with your chicken?
I would love to have some salad! I also have rice. Would you like some rice on the side?
Yes, I absolutely love chicken and rice. Excellent! If Julie could pass this plate down to you, we can dig in!
Oh Ashley, your dinner looks delicious! I appreciate the compliment, Joe. What would you prefer with your meal--wine, mango juice, or water?
Mango juice would be a good choice for me. Julie can pour your drink for you. Can I offer you some chicken?
Yes, that chicken looks yummy! Would you like some salad to go with your chicken?
Yes, I would enjoy having some salad. I have also prepared rice. Are you ready for some rice?
Yes, chicken and rice are a favorite of mine. Good! Julie, could you pass this plate to Joe so we can get started?
Thank you for coming, officer. What seems to be the problem?
I was in school all day and came home to a burglarized apartment. Was the door locked when you left?
The door was still locked when I came home, so maybe they came in through a window. Do you live here alone?
I have a roommate, but she is still at school. Have you seen anyone suspicious in the neighborhood?
No, nothing unusual. Well, I am going to check the windows and look for fingerprints. I want you to figure out what is missing.
I appreciate you coming so quickly, officer. Whoa, what a mess! What happened here?
Apparently while I was at school today, someone decided to help themselves to the contents of my apartment. Was everything locked up when you left?
I think that they broke in through a window. Do you have a roommate?
My boyfriend lives here with me, but he is out of town right now. Have you noticed anyone unusual around lately?
Actually, my neighbor asked me if I knew who was parked across the street the other day. Let's go through your rooms and try to figure out what has been taken.
Thank God you are here, officer. I came as soon as I could. What a mess!
When I left for school today, everything was fine. Then I came home to find my apartment had been broken into. Was the door locked when you came home?
I don't think they came in through the door maybe they entered through the window. Does anyone else live here?
I live here alone. Have you noticed any strangers or parked cars around here recently?
I really haven't been home very much lately. Let's figure out what is missing and see if there are any fingerprints left behind.
I need to have my computer fixed. What's the problem?
I think it has a virus. Did you buy your computer from us?
Yes, I bought it from your store. Did you get the warranty on your computer?
Yes, I got the warranty. My computer is showing that the warranty you bought is expired.
You can't be serious! You're going to have to pay to have your computer fixed.
How much is it going to cost? It's going to be about $120.
I need you to fix my computer. What problems are you having with it?
There is a virus on my computer. Did you get your computer from our store?
I purchased my computer from your store. Did you buy the warranty for your computer?
I did purchase the warranty. Your warranty apparently expired two months ago.
Is that right? It's going to cost you for us to fix your computer.
How much? To fix your computer, it's going to cost you about $120.
Can you fix my computer? What's wrong with it?
I believe that it has a virus. Where did you get your computer? From us?
Yes, I did. Did you purchase a warranty for the computer?
I believe that I purchased the warranty. Our records are showing that your warranty expired last month.
I don't believe it. I'm sorry, but it is going to cost you to get your computer fixed.
How much will it cost me? It'll run you about $120.
May I exchange this DVD player? Certainly. Do you have your receipt?
Here you are. Now, why do you want to exchange it?
It won't play a DVD. I'm sorry. I'll get you a new player.
At first, I thought it was me. Okay, here's a new one for you.
I'd like to exchange this DVD player. Of course. Do you have your receipt?
Here it is. Now, could you tell me why you want a different one?
It refuses to play my DVDs. That's strange. Let me get you a new one.
All my friends tried to get it to work. I hope this one works better for you.
I want to exchange this DVD player. No problem. Do you have your receipt?
That's one thing I never forget. Now, what seems to be the problem?
This DVD player won't play DVDs. Well, at least you kept your receipt. One moment, please.
I spent almost an hour trying to make it work. If this one doesn't work, just bring it back.
Can I exchange this DVD player? Let me see your receipt, please.
I always keep my receipt. Could you tell me what the problem is?
When I hit "Play," nothing happens. Yours is the first one that's been returned.
Nothing I tried would make it work. You might want to try playing this one before you leave.
I need to exchange this DVD player, please. That won't be a problem if you have your receipt.
Here you go. Now, if you'll just tell me the problem, please.
It won't play my DVDs. This is a good product. I wonder what went wrong.
I don't know. I trust this brand. This was a fluke, I think. You're right, this is a good brand. This new one should work just fine.
So where are the laundry rooms located? There is a laundry room located at the end of each hallway.
Can I use them at any time? All laundry rooms are locked at eleven at night and re-open at seven in the morning.
Do they use change? You should bring quarters for the washer and dryer.
Can you buy detergent in the laundry room? Yes, there are detergent dispensers in the laundry room.
Are there rules in the laundry room? Yes, if you leave your laundry in the machine unattended, people can just take it out and put it on a table so they may use the machine.
Does every floor have a laundry room? Each hallway has a laundry room located near the stairway.
Are they open for use around the clock? The laundry room near the recreation center is open twenty-four hours a day. The rest have posted hours.
Do I need to bring coins with me? The washers and dryers require correct change, but there is a change machine in the laundry room.
Are there any detergent dispensers in the laundry room? Yes, but they are expensive.
Are there any specific rules about doing laundry? Yes, you are only supposed to tie up three machines at a time for your own use, so that the other machines are available for other tenants.
Do you have a lot of laundry rooms? We have many laundry rooms. Your closest one is next to the pool.
Are there any certain hours we can use them. All of the laundry rooms can be used whenever you need to use them.
What type of payment do they require? If you bring dollar bills, you will be in great shape.
Is there any place to buy laundry detergent in the laundry room. There are detergent dispensers in the laundry room but it is cheaper to buy it across the street at the market.
Is there anything I should know about the rules of the laundry room? Yes, we ask that you please clean up after yourself as in wiping up spilled detergent or cleaning out lint screens.
Devi, have you thought about where would you like to go to dinner on Friday for your birthday? I am not sure. I don't know that many restaurants around here.
You know, we could look online at the local Internet sites. Good. Let's take a look!
What kind of food would you like for your birthday? I enjoy Thai or Japanese the best.
This one, Shogun, looks good. Oh yes, I've heard of that one. Everyone I've spoken with says that it is great!
Would you like to go there then? I think that that would be a really good choice! Let's call and make a reservation.
Devi, do you have any preference for where you would like to go for dinner for your birthday? I don't really know where I want to go. I am having trouble thinking of a particular restaurant.
There is a great restaurant directory here in the weekend section of the newspaper. OK, we could look at that.
Do you have a particular type of food that you would like? I really like Japanese or Thai food.
That Japanese restaurant, Shogun, got good reviews. Oh yeah! I saw a review of that restaurant on television. The reviewer loved it!
Would that be a place that you might like to go to for your birthday? That would work out great! Why don't we call and get a reservation?
Devi, do you have a favorite place that you would like to go to for your birthday dinner? I am kind of at a loss right now to think of some place special. 
I've got a great guidebook here of local restaurants. That would be a good place to look.
What is your favorite type of restaurant food? I like a lot of things, but Thai or Japanese would be good.
Shogun looks pretty good! Oh, I remember that restaurant. I went there years ago. I really enjoyed it!
Would that be a good choice for your birthday dinner then? I would enjoy going there. Let's call ahead to make sure that we can get a table for that night.
Do you have any other questions? I want to know about fees.
Which fees? Overdraft fees.
You will be required to pay a small fee for every time you overdraft. How much is the fee?
You'll have to pay $25 every time you overdraft. That's a small fee?
It should stop you from overdrafting. You would think it would, but it most likely won't.
Can I help you with anything else? That's it for today. Thank you.
Do you have any questions? Tell me about fees.
What fees are you referring to? I want to know about overdraft fees.
We charge a small fee every time you overdraft. How much?
For each time you overdraft, you have to pay $25. That's not a small fee.
You shouldn't overdraft. That's for sure.
Do you need help with anything else? That's all I needed to know. Thanks.
Would you like to ask any questions? I need to know about the fees.
What kind of fees? I'm asking about overdraft fees.
You have to pay a small fee every time you overdraft. What's the fee?
The fee is $25 every time you overdraft. How is that a small fee?
That fee should keep you from overdrafting. I'll say.
Do you have any more questions? I don't need to know anything else. Thank you.
Good evening, sir, and welcome to Chez Attitude. We have a dinner reservation for four at 7:00 under the name of Foster.
Yes, Mr. Foster, if you would please be seated over in the waiting area, our hostess will be with you in a moment. Thank you. Would it be OK if we have a cocktail while we are waiting?
Of course, I will tell her. I would really prefer an outside table. Would that be possible?
Sure, if you would like one of those tables, I could seat you right away. Sure, that would be great! Thank you!
Here are your menus and the wine menu, and would you like to order your drinks now? Yes, I would like a vodka gimlet, please.
Sure, no problem, sir. Thank you very much.

I will let her know where you are. The patio tables look really nice. Could we be seated there, please?
I could seat you right away at an outside table if you would like. Thanks! We'll sit out there then. We will just order our drinks out there.
Can I start you off with some cocktails while you are looking over the menu? Yes, why don't you bring us a bottle of the house Chablis with four glasses to start with?
I'll get on that right away! We appreciate your help.
Thank you for joining us this evening at Chez Attitude. I am Mr. Foster, and we have a 7:00 dinner reservation tonight for four people.

She will come and let you know when your table is prepared. Those patio tables are new, aren't they? Would it be possible to be seated out there?
An outside table is available right now if you would like to be seated immediately. We would love to sit outside. Thanks for your help!
Here is your table, and now may I take your drink order while you are considering what to have for dinner? Yes, could you please bring us a pitcher of margaritas and four glasses while we are figuring out our dinner order?
I'll put your drink order in and be right back to get your dinner order. We'll be ready to order by the time you get back!
Do you like the apartment so far? I see a problem.
What's the problem? I noticed that the faucet in the kitchen is leaking.
That's no big deal. It's going to be a problem when my water bill comes.
What do you want me to do about it? I would like you to fix the problem.
I won't be able to do that right now. Well, I won't be able to rent the apartment until the problem is fixed.
Fine, I'll have it fixed for you. I'm happy that we've come to an agreement.
How do you like the apartment? I like the apartment, but I see something wrong with it.
What's wrong? There's a leaking faucet in the kitchen.
That isn't a problem. That leak is going to raise my water bill.
What can I do? You need to fix it.
I can't right now. I won't rent it if the faucet isn't fixed.
I will fix it for you. I'm glad you finally agree.
What do you think of the apartment? I like it, but there is one problem.
What problem is that? The faucet in the kitchen is leaking.
I don't understand what the big deal is. That leak is a problem for my water bill.
What you would like me to do about it? The leak must be fixed.
I won't be able to fix it at the moment. I will not rent the apartment with that leaking faucet.
If that's the case, then I will fix the faucet. Thanks for understanding.
Hello, Nicole here. Nicole, this is Richard. I think you know why I'm calling.
Oh, it's about the rent. Yes, this is the second month in a row.
I thought there was a grace period. There is no grace period in the rental agreement.
Oh, I guess I forgot. Well, when can I expect the rent?
You'll get it by Monday. Don't forget the $50 late fee.
Is that in the rental agreement? The late fee is circled in red ink!
Oh, Well, I can't find my copy of the agreement. If you're late next month, I might give you an eviction notice.
Hi, this is Nicole. Hi, Nicole. Richard here. I think you've got a good idea why I'm calling.
Yes. It's about the rent, isn't it? Yes, your rent is late. This is the second month in a row.
But I thought that I had a grace period. I told you last month that the rental agreement contains no grace period.
Oh, I guess I was thinking about the last place that I lived. Well, tell me when I'm going to get your rent.
I get paid tomorrow, so you'll get the check by Monday. Don't forget to include the $50 late fee.
Are you sure a late fee is in the rental agreement? How could you miss the late fee? It's circled in red ink!
I can't find my copy of the rental agreement. I know it's somewhere in my apartment. If you're late one more time, I'm probably going to evict you.
Hello, Nicole here. Who's calling, please? Hey, Nicole. It's Richard. I'm pretty sure you know why I'm calling.
Yes, a dollar gets a dime that you're calling about the rent. Nicole, for the second month in a row, your rent is late.
I thought you said there is a grace period. No, I didn't. There was no grace period last month, this month, or any month.
Maybe I'm confusing this place with my last place. Well, I'm waiting to receive your rent check.
I get my money tomorrow, so I can pay you by Monday. Remember, just like last month, you have to pay the $50 late fee.
I don't remember seeing a late fee in the rental agreement. If you look at your agreement, you'll see the late fee circled in red ink!
I forget where I put my rental agreement. One more late check, and you're looking at eviction.
Hello. This is Nicole. This is Richard. Let's not play games. You know why I'm calling.
Oh, not again! You're calling about the rent. Yes, your rent check is late, just like last month.
What happened to my grace period? Why would there be a grace period this month? There wasn't one last month.
I guess I might be a little confused. What day in the near future can I expect your check?
My boss told me he will pay me tomorrow. You'll get my check by Monday. Remember to include the $50 late fee.
Are you sure the rental agreement included a late fee? The red ink around the late fee in your agreement should tell you something.
I seem to have lost my rental agreement. Don't be late again, or you'll be evicted.
Hi, this is Nicole. Nicole, it's Richard. You know why I'm calling.
Yes, I know. It's the rent, isn't it? Yes, just like last month, your rent is overdue.
What about my grace period? Are you getting Alzheimer's? There is no grace period in the rental agreement.
Sometimes my memory isn't so good. Maybe I do have Alzheimer's. I'm looking forward to receiving your check in the very near future.
Is Monday okay? I get paid tomorrow. Remember that the check amount must include the $50 late fee.
Okay, if the rental agreement actually has a late fee, I'll pay the fifty dollars. Look at your agreement. There's a big red circle around the late fee.
As soon as I find my rental agreement, I'll read it again. I'm not giving you any more chances. Be late again, and you'll be evicted.
I wanted to ask you a few questions. What about?
They are pertaining to the neighborhood that the apartment is in. Sure. What would you like to know?
What can you tell me about the neighborhood? In all honesty, the neighborhood could be a little nicer.
What do you mean by that? The neighborhood streets are a little dirty.
Is there anything else wrong with the neighborhood? That's just about it.
Hopefully the cleanliness problem will get better. I hope so, too.
I have a few questions for you. What are your questions about?
They're questions about the neighborhood. What are your questions?
If you don't mind, would you tell me something about the neighborhood? I think the neighborhood could be better.
What problems does the neighborhood have? A lot of the streets are rather unclean.
What else is wrong with it? Nothing else that I can think of.
Maybe in time they will clean up the streets. Maybe they will.
May I ask you a couple of questions? What are these questions pertaining to?
Just a few questions about the neighborhood. Okay. Ask away.
Tell me about the neighborhood. The neighborhood does have its problems.
How is that? What I mean is that the streets aren't all that clean.
Are there any other problems? Other than it not being so clean, it's actually a nice neighborhood.
I'm sure that the problem will eventually be fixed. I hope that you're right.
Is the moving van here yet? Yes, it just pulled up to the curb. Here we go! 
Could you double-check and make sure that everything made it into the boxes? I have already done that. Would you like me to put our suitcases into the car?
Yes, this would be a good time to do that. I am so glad that we took the time to pack our essentials into suitcases. It will tide us over until the van arrives at our new home.
Would this be a good time to pack the frozen food into the ice chest? I think that we should wait until the very last minute to do that.
I am going to take the dog for a walk so that he doesn't get too stressed out as the movers are working. Well, let's get started sweeping up and do a last minute cleaning.
Do you think that the moving van has arrived? It's coming down the street even as we speak.
Could I ask you to make one last check to make sure that everything got into the boxes? Relax. Do you need me to put the suitcases in the car?
Yes, let's do that right now.  It was such a good idea to pack a suitcase to have some things with us while we are waiting for the moving van to arrive on the other end.
Maybe we could pack the frozen food into the ice chest? Let's wait until the van is almost completely loaded to take care of that.
I am sure happy that we dropped the cats off at the kennel so they aren't freaking out. I am going to start sweeping up the floor. I want the new owners to not have to clean up a mess.
Could you check and see if the moving van is out there yet? It just arrived. They are parking at the curb right now.
Do me a favor and do one last walk-through to check for anything that may not have gotten packed. We've already double-checked everything. Should we put the suitcases in the car?
It is the perfect time to take care of that. I am so happy that we didn't pack all of our clothes into boxes. The suitcase of clothes will help us get to what we need until our boxes arrive.
Should we empty the freezer into the ice chest? Let's do a few more things and then take care of that as one of the last things we do.
Deciding to keep the birds at the neighbors until we leave was a good idea. Let's sweep the floor on our way out so we don't leave too big of a mess behind.
Good afternoon, Jim. This is Olivia. Oh, hi, Olivia. How can I help you?
I'm going to be moving out. Oh, really? When are you leaving?
I'll be leaving on the last day of June. Any particular reason?
I got a new job. Congratulations! What is it?
I'm going to be an ESL instructor at Pasadena City College. Great! By the way, what's ESL?
ESL stands for English as a Second Language. Well, I'm glad it wasn't your neighbors causing you to move.
Just because they play their TV loud enough for the whole complex? Yes, I know. I'm going to have another talk with them.
Anyway, it's been nice knowing you for these past few years. You, too. Keep in touch, and good luck with your new job.
How's it going, Jim? This is Olivia. Hello, Olivia. What's up?
I wanted to let you know that I have to move out. I'm sorry to hear that. When are you moving?
The thirtieth of June. May I ask why you're leaving?
I found a new job. Good for you! What's your new job?
I am an ESL teacher at Pasadena City College. Very good! What does ESL mean?
ESL means English as a Second Language. Well, I'm glad you're not moving because of your neighbors.
I can't tell you how happy I'll be not to have to listen to their TV. Yes, I'm going to tell them one more time to turn down their TV and keep it down.
You've been a good apartment manager and a good person. I'll see you in June. Thank you. I hope your new job and new apartment are good for you.
Hey, Jim. How are you? Olivia here. Hi, Olivia. What's going on?
I just wanted to give you notice that I'm moving. Oh, that's too bad. What's the moving date?
I'll be gone on the last day in June. Can I ask you why you're moving?
I've been looking for a long time, and I finally found a good job. Very good! What's your new job?
I'm going to teach ESL at Pasadena City College. Good for you! What does ESL stand for?
ESL is English as a Second Language. Well, I'm glad you don't feel you're being chased out by your neighbors.
Their TV is so loud you'd think they were stone deaf. I'll tell them one more time to turn down their TV. Then I'm going to evict them.
Thanks for all your help over the past few years. Thanks. Good luck with your new neighbors and your new job.
Hi, Jim. It's Olivia. Hey, Olivia. What's happening?
I'll be moving out in a while, so I wanted you to know. Well, that's not good news. When are you moving?
The last day of June. Is something wrong with your apartment?
No, not anything new. But I just found out that I've been hired for a new job. Great! What is the new job?
I'm going to be an ESL instructor at Pasadena City College. That's great! ESL is some kind of electronics class?
ESL is a class for students who are learning English as their second language. I'm glad that your neighbors aren't the reason that you're moving.
I won't miss having to listen to their darn TV. I'm giving them one more warning about their TV. Then they're out of there.
I appreciate what a good apartment manager you've been these past few years. It's been nice knowing you, too. Good luck teaching LES.
Hello, Jim. It's Olivia. Hi, there. What can I do for you today?
You should know that I'll be moving out in a while. Gee, that's too bad. What day do you plan to leave?
June 30 is my last day. I hope it's not your neighbors or the latest rent increase.
No, neither one. I got lucky. I found a new job. Hey, give me five! Good for you! What is it?
I'll be teaching ESL at Pasadena City College. Great! Is ESL a class about the Internet?
No. ESL is English for students whose native language is not English. I was worried that you were moving because of your neighbors.
Whoever my next neighbor is cannot possibly be as loud as those people. I'm going to give them 30 days' notice if they don't turn that TV down.
Thanks for everything. I'll give you the keys on the thirtieth. You've been a very good tenant. Good luck with your new SLE job.

I just arrived and need help getting transportation to my hotel. There are shuttles, taxis, and buses that go all over the city.
Which one is the best form of transportation? It depends on where you want to go. If you are going to a well-known hotel, they have their own shuttles that drop you right off at the door.
Where can I catch a cab? All ground transportation leaves from the island as you walk out the arrivals gate.
Where can I rent a car? The car rental agencies are against the wall as you exit.
Are there any subways in this town? We have a subway system, but you need to take a shuttle to get to the station.
I need help figuring out how to get to my friend's house in the city. You may take a shuttle, a taxi, or a bus to get wherever you need to go.
Which form of transportation is preferable? It depends on what you are looking for. If you are looking to travel inexpensively, a bus might be your best bet.
Where do the buses pick you up? The ground transportation center is right outside the exit leading to the street.
Is there a car rental place around here? You can find a car rental agency just outside of baggage claim.
Is there a subway in this city? Our subway station is a mile outside of the airport. I would suggest you take the designated shuttle to get there.
I need information about my options for ground transportation. This city has many taxis, shuttles, or buses to transport you to your destination.
Is one form of transportation better than another? It depends on where you are traveling. If your destination is close by, you might want to just grab a taxicab.
Where are the shuttle pick-up points? When you pick up your luggage, walk out of the door and you will see the transportation kiosk.
Where are the car rental agencies? You will see the car rental agencies as you walk down the hallway as you exit.
I heard that you have a very good light rail system in this city. We have a subway station in the airport. The in-airport moving sidewalk system will take you to it.
Is this the Resume Writing Workshop? Yes, this is the Resume Writing Workshop. Welcome!
I really don't know that much about putting together a resume. It's easy. Don't worry about it.
What's the most important part? Well, the most important thing we need to do is make sure that our name and contact information are across the top.
What comes next? You can either list your job experience next or your education--whichever is the most impressive should be first.
Can I list my interests next? Sure, that would be a good place for them.
I was wondering if this is where the Resume Writing Workshop is being held. You are in the right place. Please come on in!
It's been a long time since I've had to look for work and put a resume together. It's going to come together just fine. Trust me!
Where do we begin? We start at the top with our name and contact information. Make sure the information is current.
Then what do we do? Put your job experience first, if that is more impressive than your education.
What about listing my interests and affiliations next? Yes, that would make a good ending for your resume.
I was looking for the Resume Writing Workshop. You came to the right spot. Come on in and join us!
I am not really sure that I remember how to even put a resume together. I am here to show you how to put together the perfect resume. It will turn out great!
How do we get started? We need to put our name and contact information across the top.
Then what? You can list your education at the top, or choose your job experience to be there if it is more impressive.
Could I list my interests and special skills next? I think that that would work out quite well as an ending for your resume.
Joe, how are you doing today? Pretty good. Mary, I was wondering if you would like to come to a party on Friday night?
I am free that night, and a party sounds good. Fine. It will be at my house. Do you know how to get there?
I kind of know where you live, but could you e-mail me your address? I can do that. Do you have anyone that you would like to bring with you to the party?
I would really like to bring my friend Jake, if that would be OK. Oh yeah, I remember Jake. That would be fine.
Would you like some help with the food? Just bring along whatever it is that you and Jake would like to drink.
Hi Joe, is everything going OK with you? Things are great. Mary, I am having a party on Friday night and was wondering if you would be available?
I would love to come to your party! I am glad you are free. Do you know how to get to my house?
If you would e-mail me your address, that would help. Sure, no problem. Can you think of anyone else I can invite to the party?
My friend Jake is in town, and I would like it if I could bring him. Sure, bring Jake along. The more the merrier!
Can I bring anything? If there is something special that you and Jake would like to drink, bring that along.
Hey Joe, how's it going? Oh good, Mary. I was hoping I'd see you today. Would you like to come to a party on Friday night?
A party would be a perfect way to end the week! Good! Do you need my address?
I've been to your house once, but I would appreciate you e-mailing me your address. That would be no trouble at all. Who else do you think I should ask to the party?
I don't know if you remember my friend Jake, but I would like to bring him with me. Jake would be welcome. If you think of anyone else, feel free to bring them along also.
What would you like me to bring? Everything is taken care of, but if you and Jake want to bring something to drink, that would be appreciated.
So, how are you feeling today? I'm pretty tired. I haven't been sleeping well.
Do you have enough time to get the right amount of sleep? I have enough time. I just can't seem to fall asleep and stay asleep.
What time do you usually go to bed? I don't have one time in particular. I just go to sleep whenever I feel tired.
Have you been under a lot of stress lately? I just lost my job, and I am unsure about being able to find another one.
Have you ever tried doing relaxation exercises before you go to bed? I haven't ever tried that, but it sounds like a good idea.
How have you been doing lately? Actually, I haven't been sleeping well. I am kind of out of it.
Is there some reason why you can't get enough sleep? I go to bed, but I just can't get comfortable enough to stay asleep.
When do you turn in for the night? I usually try to go to bed around 11:00 or so during the week.
Do you have a lot on your mind when you try to go to sleep? My mother is ill with cancer, and I think about her a lot.
Do you ever meditate or read before bedtime? I usually watch a lot of television before I go to bed. Maybe I should try something else to help me quiet down.
Has everything been OK with you lately? I haven't been able to get a good night's sleep lately. I'm exhausted!
Have you been too busy to get enough sleep? I try to go to sleep, but I just can't stay asleep.
How late do you try to go to sleep? I go to bed when I finish my work.
Has anything in your day-to-day life been bothering you lately? I am worried about how I am going to pay my tuition.
You might consider listening to relaxing music as you go to sleep to clear your head. Doing something relaxing before I go to sleep sounds like a plan.
What seems to be the problem? Oh, my God! It's my stomach. It's killing me!
Where does it hurt the most? Right here! It hurts right here!
How long has it felt like this? I felt OK when I woke up, and then, suddenly, I had this really sharp pain.
Do you have a history of stomach pain? No, and I haven't done anything out of the ordinary.
I think that we are going to have to get you to an emergency room right away. Thank you for helping me.
Can you tell me where it hurts? I am so glad they called you. It feels like something is really wrong with my stomach!
Does it hurt when I push here? It's mostly on my right side. Right here!
Have you been feeling this way for awhile? I started feeling kind of sick last night after dinner, but this morning the pain got really bad!
Have you eaten anything unusual lately? No, not that I remember.
We are going to take you to an emergency room right now. I will feel better when I know what the problem is. Thank you.
Where are you feeling the pain? I can't stand up! My stomach is killing me!
Can you put your hand where it hurts the most? It hurts smack in the middle of my gut!
Did this just come on suddenly? I felt OK until an hour or so ago, and then I just doubled over.
Have you exercised strenuously or played sports recently? No, and I don't usually get a lot of stomachaches.
We need to get you to an emergency room to see what the problem is. I think that that is the best way to figure out what is causing this. Thank you.
I need to make an appointment to see the doctor. What seems to be the problem?
I have a rash that I need a doctor to look at. Do you have a fever with that rash?
No, it just itches a lot. I have openings on Tuesday or Wednesday. Which would be best for you?
I need an appointment on Tuesday. Fine, I am putting you down for 9:00 on that day. Would you like to see Dr. Smith or Dr. Jones?
I would like to see Dr. Jones. I can schedule you with him with no problem. We look forward to seeing you.
Good morning, I would like to make a doctor's appointment. Can you describe your health concern?
I have been having skin problems that aren't going away. Are you in any pain?
No. Except for the rash, I feel fine. Would Tuesday or Wednesday be best for you?
I would like to come in on Tuesday. I will write you in for that day at 4:00. You can see either Dr. Smith or Dr. Jones.
I would like to see Dr. Smith. I will write you in on that doctor's schedule. See you then.
I need to come in and see the doctor. Are you scheduling a check-up, or are you ill?
I have really itchy skin and think I may have to have it looked at. Have you been feeling any joint aches with that rash?
No, but I have a low fever. I have times available for Tuesday or Wednesday. Which one would work best for you?
I want to come in on Wednesday. I can fit you in on that day at 10:00. Dr. Smith or Dr. Jones is available.
I would prefer Dr. Smith. You can see the doctor of your choice then, and we will see you at your scheduled appointment time.
Their wedding was absolutely beautiful. It really was. I want a wedding like that.
How much do you think they spent on their wedding? I think it might've cost them a nice chunk of change.
Do you want a big wedding like that? Not really. I'd rather have a small wedding.
I wouldn't want a small wedding. Why not?
I want my wedding to be big and memorable. It can be small and memorable too.
Well, to each his own. You are absolutely right.
Their wedding was just exquisite. I know. Maybe one day I'll have a wedding like that.
What do you think their budget was? It must have cost them a pretty penny.
Would you like to have a big wedding like they did? No. I think I would prefer a smaller wedding.
I want a big wedding. How come?
I want my wedding to be extravagant, and I want everyone to remember it. Your wedding doesn't have to be big to be memorable.
Whatever floats your boat. That is correct.
Their wedding was so beautiful. I agree completely. I hope that I have a wedding like that one day.
How much do you reckon it cost to pull that wedding off? I think it cost them a lot of money.
Do you hope to have a wedding as big as theirs? I don't think so. I want to have a smaller wedding.
Not me. Why do you want a bigger wedding?
I want to have a large wedding that everyone will remember. You can have a small wedding, and people will still remember it.
Whatever flicks your Bic. That is true.
Those neighbors of mine are so noisy! Yes, I can hear them. What is that pounding sound?
I think that they are hammering nails to hang pictures. How often do you hear them making noise?
They play their music really loud, and I can hear it. Have you spoken to them about the noise problem?
No, I haven't spoken with them about it. What else do you hear that bothers you?
I hear a lot of plumbing sounds, like the toilet flushing and the dishwasher running. If this continues, I would speak to the manager.
I am really losing patience with my noisy neighbors! They are noisy, all right. What do you think is making that sound?
I think they are hammering some new flooring down in their living room. Do they usually make a lot of noise?
I can hear music through the walls all the time. Do you ever tell your neighbors about the noise problem?
No, I don't know them very well. Are there any other sounds that you can hear?
I hear them talking loudly a lot, and their television is really loud. I would talk to the manager if the noise continues.
Those noisy neighbors of mine are driving me crazy! Yes, they are very noisy. What do you think they are doing in there?
Someone said they are installing some countertops in their kitchen. Is there usually a lot of noise coming from over there?
Whenever they play music, I can hear it coming through the walls. Do your neighbors know that you can hear them?
I mentioned it to them once. Are you ever disturbed by other sounds?
They have a lot of noisy parties that get out of hand. I think that you should talk with the manager to see if he can help you.
Good morning, is this Ryan? You are speaking with Ryan. How can I help you?
Ryan, this is Malia, and I need to call in sick today. What seems to be the problem?
I went hiking and have terrible poison oak. When did you get that?
I think I got it on Saturday, but it just showed up today. What are you doing for it?
The doctor prescribed an ointment and gave me a shot. Good. You probably should be much better by tomorrow.
May I speak to Ryan, please? This is Ryan you are speaking with. What can I do for you?
Hi, Ryan, this is Malia, and I will not be coming to work today. What is wrong with you?
I have really bad poison oak and can't stop itching. How long have you had it?
I've had it a few days, but the rash really got bad last night. How have you been treating it?
I have some lotion that the doctor gave me, as well as an antihistamine. That should work. I'll see you tomorrow when you return to work.
I would like to speak with Ryan. This is Ryan. How may I help you?
Ryan, this is Malia, and I am afraid that I am feeling a bit under the weather. Do you know what the problem is?
I have a horrible rash from poison oak. Have you had it a long time?
The doctor said that I probably have had it a few days. Have you been using anything for it?
I bought some over-the-counter lotion, and I am taking an antihistamine. That will probably take care of your symptoms. I'll see you tomorrow.
How may I help you? I would like to return an item.
What are you returning? I want to return this cellphone.
Is there a problem? It's broken.
What exactly is wrong with it? The phone turns off by itself.
That's fine, but do you have your receipt with you? Yes, here it is.
I'll refund your money right now. Thank you so much.
How can I help you today? I am returning something that I bought yesterday.
What would you like to return? I'm returning a cellphone.
Was there something wrong with it? It's defective.
What isn't working on it? It keeps turning off on its own.
Alright, do you have the receipt? I have it right here.
I'm going to take care of this and refund your money. Thanks for your help.
What can I do for you? I need to return something.
What do you need to return? I need to return this cellphone that I just bought.
What is wrong with it? It isn't working properly.
What is the problem with it? For some reason the phone cuts off by itself.
I see, and do you have your receipt? Here you go.
I'll take care of this right now. I appreciate your help.
I want to find an old music box. We have a great selection. What decade are you looking for?
Do you have anything made in the 1920s? We have six.
Do any of them have dancing figures? Actually, two of them have dancing figures.
That's fantastic. I think I like this one. A good choice. I prefer that one myself.
Is there any warranty with this? Oh, no, I'm afraid not. These things are just too old to guarantee anything.
I understand. Even if they break down, they're still works of art.
Excuse me. I'm looking for an old music box. Any particular decade?
Something made in the 20s would be nice. We had seven, but we sold one this morning.
Are dancing figures a part of any of the boxes? You're in luck. Two of them have dancing figures.
These are great. I think I'll take this one. Yes, that one is very nice.
Does this come with a warranty? I'm sorry, but you just have to take your chances.
That doesn't surprise me. Even if it doesn't work, it's a beautiful collectible.
Pardon me. I need an old music box. Exactly how old a box do you want?
Actually, I was thinking about something from the 1920s. We still have six left.
Do any of the boxes have dancing figures? Dancing figures are quite popular. Two of the boxes have them.
I love the dancing figures. I'll take this music box. Yes, I think you'll be very satisfied with that one.
I was wondering, does this come with any kind of warranty? No. But if something goes wrong with it, I know someone who repairs these things.
I was just hoping. It's amazing that these things still work as well as they do.
I want to purchase an old music box. We have a good variety. What decade would you like?
I was hoping I could find something made in the 20s. There are six on this table.
I hope at least one of them has dancing figures. Many people like the dancing figures. Two of our boxes have the figures.
It's so hard to choose. I think I'll take this one. That one will bring you many hours of pleasure.
Does a warranty come with this music box? I'm sorry, but if it breaks down, you're on your own.
I just thought I would ask. When you buy a Model T, you can't expect a warranty.
I'm searching for an old music box. You came to the right place. Any particular decade?
If you had a box made in the 20s, that would be nice. We just got one in yesterday, so now we have six.
Would any of them have dancing figures? Yes, we still have two boxes left that have dancing figures.
They're both so beautiful. Let me have this one, I think. That one truly is a beautiful piece of work, isn't it?
One last question: Do you provide a warranty with the box? Oh, no. Everything we sell here is ‘as is.'
I guess I was asking for too much. If it breaks down, maybe you can find a repairman on the Internet.
Can you help me figure out some inexpensive ways to fix up the exterior of my home? Like the interior, the number one thing you can do is to repaint the outside of your home if it needs it.
What do you think of the landscaping? Your lawn looks really good. Perhaps you could get some timers installed for your sprinklers.
How about adding some flowers or something? Colorful flowers are always a nice addition to a yard to add curb appeal.
What about fixing up the backyard? Make sure the lawn is well trimmed and the bushes are cut back.
Can you think of any more overall suggestions for the exterior? Wash all of the windows inside and out.
What can I do to fix up the exterior of my home? I would say the number one thing that you can do is paint your home, but your home has been painted recently and looks great!
What can I do about the landscaping? Your lawn looks a little dried out. I think all it needs is a little fertilizer and water.
My front yard looks a little boring. How can I brighten it up? I would definitely put in some new plantings to liven your yard up a bit.
Should I be worried about what my backyard looks like? You need to repair that section where your fence is falling down.
What else can I do to make the exterior of the house look extra good to buyers? Make sure to keep the sidewalks and driveways swept clean at all times.
I keep hearing about curb appeal and want to know how to achieve it. The paint job on your home looks pretty good, but I would touch up the wooden trim a little where you have some peeling spots.
I am not so sure that everyone will like the landscaping. Your lawn is a disaster! To get top dollar for your home, you should replace it.
Is there anything I can do to add some interest to my front yard? You have beautiful plants in your yard, although some of them aren't in bloom right now. Just add a few colorful flowers in pots.
Is the appearance of the backyard important? If you can borrow some really nice patio furniture to show off your lovely patio, that would be nice.
Any final suggestions on how I can make the exterior of my house even more appealing? Having your trees and bushes trimmed could be a good investment.
My flight just arrived late, and I need to know what to do. That's okay. The airline computer is keeping track of what is happening with you.
Do I have to call anyone? By speaking with us at the arrival gate, we can fix the problem for you and direct you.
What if there are no more connecting flights for today on this airline? We will go online to see if there is something available with this airline. If we need to, we can check for a flight with another carrier.
What if I can't find another flight out of here tonight? We can help you find transportation to a local hotel.
Will the airline pay for my room if I have to spend the night at the airport? Since the flight delay was our fault and you are continuing on with our airline, we will cover the cost of a hotel room.
Our flight was late, and I missed my connecting flight. We can help you find an alternate flight that will get you where you are going.
Whom should I call? The arrival gate is where you need to find someone to help you. You are in the right place.
I think the flight we missed was the last flight out of here today. We can go on the computer to try to find an alternate flight on another airline if we cannot accommodate you.
What if I get stuck here and can't get out of this airport? There is a shuttle that is still running and can take you into town to a hotel.
I don't have any money for a hotel room. The flight that you missed is not with our airline, and we would not have suggested booking the flights so close together. We won't pay for your hotel room.
I had a connecting flight, but our arriving flight was late. We will help you make alternative plans.
Can you give me the number of the airline so that I can call? The airlines always have personnel at the arrival gate to help direct you when a flight is late. We can help you right here.
I remember that when we booked this flight, our connecting flight was the only one on this day. Our ticketing is tied in with other airlines. If we cannot accommodate you, perhaps another airline has some open seats to your destination.
Where will I stay if I can't get another flight tonight? Since I believe there is a flight out of here at 5:45 in the morning, you may want to consider just staying at the airport.
I don't think I should have to pay for a hotel room. We will pay 50 percent of the price of your room.
I really like the way this house looks. Yes, it has great curb appeal.
The landscaping is wonderful! Yes, it is nice, but wait until you see the interior.
I see what you mean! The carpeting and paint are all new, as well as the window treatments.
I love the sage green carpeting with the sunset-colored walls. Come and see the kitchen.
Look at that beautiful countertop material and the double sink! Let's go check out the bedroom and bathroom.
I really like the Jacuzzi bathtub in the bathroom. I am happy that you like the house. We should write down what we like so that we can remember it.
I have a good feeling about this house. Yes, I liked it the first moment I pulled up to it.
I love the paint job! If you like the outside, you are going to really love the inside.
What a beautiful home! You'll notice that the window treatments, carpeting, and drapes are all new.
I like the way the blinds give you privacy from the street. Follow me into the kitchen. You will love it.
I love that they put a wine storage area in the kitchen. The best part is the bedroom and attached bathroom.
I love the relaxing colors in the tile and floor covering! Let's take a few pictures so that we can remember what we like about this house.
This looks like a very nice house. You know, I fell in love with this house the first moment I laid eyes on it.
The style of the exterior is just what I've been looking for! The exterior is only half of the story. The interior is incredible.
This home is gorgeous on the inside! Everything that you see on the walls, floors, and windows is brand new.
The wall colors totally suit the style of this house. Straight ahead is the gourmet kitchen.
I love the bamboo flooring and granite countertops. The master suite is the best. Let's go look at that next.
There is plenty of room for our king-sized bed, and I love the light in this room. I know that you like this house, but let's take a look at the others before you make up your mind.
How are you feeling today? I have a terrible cold!
Where do you think you picked that up? A lot of people in my gym have it. Maybe I got it from the equipment.
Have you taken anything for it? I think that I am just going to rest and drink plenty of liquids for a while.
Yes, staying rested and hydrated is really important. My mother also has this special potion with hot wine, cayenne pepper, and sugar that works miracles.
You might want to ask the pharmacist for his suggestions if you get any worse. Yes, if my symptoms don't pass in a few days, I will ask for help.
You don't look so good. I feel horrible. I think I picked up a bug.
Do you know who you got it from? A lot of people in my dorm are sick. Perhaps I picked it up there.
Did you take any cold medication? I've been taking vitamin C and zinc and trying to get some rest.
I think that rest and liquids are what doctors recommend for a cold. My grandmother swears by hot chicken soup for a cold.
A pharmacist might be able to help you if your home remedies don't work. Yes, if I get worse, I will definitely look for extra help with this.
You look a bit under the weather. I am not feeling all the great. I think I have that crud that is going around.
I know that it's going around the dorms. My boyfriend hasn't been feeling so well. Maybe he passed it on to me.
I have some cold tablets if you would like one. Mostly, I feel like I need some rest and hot soup.
Drinking liquids and getting rest is a good idea with a cold. My grandmother thinks that honey and whiskey is a good cure for a cold.
You could always go to the pharmacy if it gets worse and you want suggestions. If things don't get better in a few days, I will look for some other solutions.
I want to get a snack at the cafeteria. What are you going to buy?
I may just get some chips. I'm probably going to buy something too.
What do you want to get? I want some sort of candy.
What kind do you want? I want some chocolate.
What kind of chocolate? I'm going to get a Snickers or a Kit Kat.
I don't think they sell Kit Kats. I'll just get a Snickers then.
Let's go and get something from the cafeteria. What are you going to get?
I think I just want some chips. I want to get a snack too.
What are you getting? I have a taste for candy.
What kind are you going to get? Chocolate sounds good.
What kind are you going to get? I'm thinking of getting either a Snickers or a Kit Kat.
They don't sell Kit Kats at the cafeteria. I'm just going to buy a Snickers then.
I need a snack from the cafeteria. What are you thinking of getting?
I only want some chips. I think I may get something too.
What do you plan on buying? I have a sweet tooth. I want candy.
What kind of candy do you want? I really want some chocolate.
What kind of chocolate do you want? I either want a Snickers or a Kit Kat.
The cafeteria doesn't sell Kit Kats. Then I guess I'll just get a Snickers.
I have been having a lot of headaches lately. Have you been having these headaches for a long time?
I have had headaches my whole life, but they have been getting worse lately. Have you been under a lot of stress lately?
I've been under stress, but no more than usual. Have you been getting enough sleep lately?
No, I only sleep a few hours a night. Have you had any head injuries lately?
Yes, actually I fell skiing last week and hit my head. I am going to send you for a CT scan, and I will see you again when we see the results.
I have been getting headaches almost every day lately. Have you just started getting a lot of headaches?
I never had very many headaches before, but the last few weeks I have been getting a lot of them. Have you had any unusually stressful situations in your life lately?
My mother just passed away last Tuesday. I'm sorry. How about sleep? Are you getting enough rest?
I have been working really hard, and sleep has not been a priority. Have you bumped your head or fallen lately?
No, I haven't hit my head. I am going to send you to a neurologist for a few tests.
I have had some really horrible headaches lately. How long have your headaches been going on?
I get headaches occasionally, but they have been really bad lately. Any unusual amounts of stress in your life going on right now?
I am getting ready to take my GRE. Have you been able to sleep regular hours?
It has been hard for me to sleep with a bad headache. Has anything hit you in the head lately?
I hit my head on a cupboard door a week ago. Let's have you come back in a few days and see how you feel.
My wife thinks I should get a lawyer to look at the contract. Well, it certainly wouldn't hurt to have a lawyer review it.
How much does a lawyer cost? I don't know. A good real estate lawyer might cost $400 an hour.
That can't be legal!  Just think how much it'll be 10 years from now.
Do you know any lawyers that are cheaper than that? You'd have to check the yellow pages or go online.
There's no telling how many hours the lawyer will charge me for. Also, it might take a week or two just to get an appointment.
I'd rather get this over with, so just show me where to sign. Good man! I've marked all the places for you to sign and date.
My wife said to have a lawyer look at the contract. That's always a good idea.
Do you know how much a lawyer runs? I've heard that they're about $400 an hour.
Who can afford that? A few years ago, $100 an hour was outrageous.
Can you help me find a cheaper lawyer? I'm afraid I can't help you with that.
The lawyer will start at $400, but where will it end? Also, a good lawyer might not have time to see you immediately.
My wife's going to kill me, but just show me where to sign. Now you're talking. The red stickers indicate where to sign and date.
My wife told me to get a lawyer to review the contract first. A smart husband always does what his wife tells him.
How much are lawyers charging nowadays? It's hard to believe, but I think they charge about $400 an hour.
That's highway robbery! I think lawyers are making twice what doctors are making.
Are there any lawyers that are cheaper than that? The best advice I can give you is to Google it.
I can barely afford one hour, but certainly not two. Remember, it might take a few days just to set up an appointment.
I really don't have the time or the money, so where do I sign? Your wife will thank you. Just sign and date where the little red stickers are.
Have you been coming to this Laundromat long? I have been washing clothes here since a few years ago.
Why is that? It doesn't cost me as much to wash here.
I've just started doing my clothes here. Why are you washing your clothes here now?
My washing machine broke down. You should just pay someone to fix it.
It's too expensive to get it fixed. So you're just going to wash here?
Yes, I think that's what I'm going to have to do. It costs less to wash here.
How long have you been washing clothes here? I started washing here about three years ago.
How come? I can wash my clothes for less money here.
This is my first time washing clothes here. What reason are you washing here today?
I can't wash at home because my machine is broken. Go and get it repaired.
That'll cost too much. Are you going to continue washing your clothes here for a while?
I have no choice. Washing clothes at a Laundromat costs a lot less money.
Do you wash clothes here often? I have been coming here for the past few years.
Why do you wash here? It's actually a lot cheaper for me to wash my clothes here.
I've only washed my clothes here a couple times. Why don't you wash clothes at home?
I would, if my washing machine wasn't broken. Why don't you just get it fixed?
I can't afford it. So you plan on washing your clothes here from now on?
That's my only option right now. Don't worry. Besides, it's a lot cheaper to wash clothes this way.
Hey, what's up? Everything's fine with me. How about you?
I need your help. What do you need?
Remember when I told you I'm going to be moving? Yeah, I remember.
Do you think you could help me move? Sure, that shouldn't be a problem. When?
Are you busy this Saturday? I don't think I have any plans.
Is 10 o'clock okay with you? That'll be fine. I'll see you then.
What's going on? Things are fine with me. What's going on with you?
Would you help me? Help you with what?
You do know I'm getting ready to move, right? I remember you telling me.
Do you mind helping me move in? I can help you with that.
Is this Saturday okay for you? I'm free this Saturday.
Can you come help me at 10:00? That's perfect. I will see you on Saturday.
What are you doing? Nothing much. What's up with you?
Actually, I was wondering if you could help me with something. What would you like me to help you with?
You know I'm going to be moving in soon? You told me already.
I was just wondering if you could help me move in. I can help you with that.
Do you have plans on Saturday? No, I don't think so.
How does 10 am sound to you? Saturday at 10:00? I can do that.
Did you go to the basketball game on Friday? No, I couldn't make it.
You missed a really good game. Oh, really? Who won?
Our school did. They played really well. Too bad I was busy. I really wanted to go.
Yeah, you should have. It was really exciting. So what was the score?
The score was 101-98. Man, that was a really close game.
That's what made it so great. I'll make sure and make it to the next one.
Were you able to attend Friday night's basketball game? I was unable to make it.
You should have been there. It was intense. Is that right. Who ended up winning?
Our team was victorious. I wish I was free that night. I'm kind of mad that I didn't go.
It was a great game. What was the score at the end of the game?
Our team won 101-98. Sounds like it was a close game.
That's the reason it was such a great game. The next game, I will definitely be there.
I was meaning to ask you if you saw the basketball game on Friday. I wanted to go, but I couldn't.
It was a great game. It's too bad that I couldn't make it. Who won?
Our team played hard and won. I really wish I went to the game.
It was the best game ever. So tell me the final score.
The other team lost by three points, 101-98.  It must've been a close game.
It really was. You should've gone. Hopefully, I'll make it to the next one.
I am a reporter from Channel 5 News. What's up?
Could I ask you some questions? Sure, you can.
Did you vote today? I sure did!
What candidate did you vote for? I can't disclose that information.

I'm reporting from Channel 5 News. How are you doing?
I want to ask you a couple questions. Go for it.

Why can't you tell me? That is private information.
I see. All I can tell you is our next President got my vote.
I'm from Channel 5 News. How's it going?
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions. Ask away.
First of all, did you vote today? I already voted.
Who did you vote for? I'm not going to tell you.
Why not? My vote is personal.
I apologize for invading your privacy. What I can tell you is that I voted for our next President of the United States.
Where are you going? I have to go to work.
Going to work where? I'm working at the polling place.
I didn't know you were working there this year. I work at the polling place every year.
How did you get that job? I signed up for it online.
That's really cool. It's a very cool job.
Do they pay you a lot? They pay well enough.
Are you going somewhere? I'm on my way to work.
Where do you work? I work at the polling place.

You have a job? I'm going to work at the polling place.

I have an interview tomorrow, so I hope I can learn everything quickly. We are all going to have great interviews. What are some things that we need to remember in an interview?
I think that we should make sure that our looks are the best they can be. Right, and what about our friendliness and attitude?
Yes, and being friendly and having a good attitude also help me relax. Did you know that they pay as much attention to what you ask as to what you say in an interview?
No, I didn't. What else should I keep in mind? Just relax, listen carefully to the questions, and be honest in your responses.

Yes, and I always feel much better when I am friendly. Believe it or not, the interviewers are as interested in your questions as they are in your answers.
Any more hints as to what I should do in an interview? Always be honest with your answers. The interviewers really do want to know if you will be a good fit for them.

Our dress and grooming are probably the first thing an interviewer judges us by. Friendliness and a good attitude are also very important.
Yes, and they help establish a friendly tone for the rest of the interview. The interviewers always are interested in what you ask them about their company.
What else should I be thinking about? Be yourself and be honest. Simply answer the questions put to you.

That rain is really coming down out there! Yes, it's kind of crazy weather outside.
I get kind of nervous flying in this kind of weather. I don't think anyone feels all that comfortable flying in a storm.
Do you think it will be this bad the whole trip? On the weather channel, this storm looked to be a big one. It will probably be with us for a while.
I worry about too much ice on the wings. I have to believe that our pilot knows what he is doing and we'll be okay.
When do you think the pilot will turn off the Fasten Your Seatbelt sign? He'll turn it off as soon as he knows that we are through the turbulence.
Do you think that we are going to crash? Maybe. You just never know.
It sure is windy out there! It definitely is not the perfect day to fly, is it?
I am scared of flying to begin with, but bad weather makes it a little worse. Anyone who actually enjoys flying in bad weather is out of their mind.
Will the whole flight be this bad? I think that it will probably let up once we get out of here. Let's cross our fingers!
What if we hit a flock of birds? Plane crashes are very rare. We'll be fine.
Do you think that the pilot will ever turn off the Fasten Your Seatbelt sign? The pilot needs to make sure that there is no more turbulence before he lets us get up.
Do you think that we are going to die? Can I buy you an alcoholic beverage?
I can't believe how bad the weather is today! Yes, according to the weather report, we will be flying through a pretty nasty storm.
I don't really like flying in this kind of weather. It is normal to feel a little nervous about flying in bad weather.
How long do you think this will last? Usually the pilot can get enough altitude to get above it. I hope that happens this time!
What if one of the engines stops working? I trust that the airline wouldn't let us take off without feeling that all was okay.
How much longer do you think that the pilot will leave the Fasten Your Seatbelt sign on? When we are past the turbulence, I am sure that the pilot will shut the light off.
Do you think we are headed for an air disaster? Would you like a pillow and blanket so you can take a nap?
Hello, I'm calling about the apartment. What would you like to know?

I was wondering about the apartment. I'd be happy to help.
Could you give me details about the apartment? What is it that you would like to know?
Actually, it's the floor plan that I am inquiring about. If you would like to, you can see it for yourself.
I am very busy and don't know when I can view the apartment. If you would like, you can view it online.
I can do that? If you would like the website, I can give it to you.
That would be more convenient than having to go all the way down there. Convenience is the reason that we made the website.
Could you help me with a question that I have about the apartment? What can I help you with?
I would like to know about the apartment. What exactly did you want to know?
I was wondering about the floor plan. You could always take a look at the floor plan.
I won't be able to come down to see it anytime soon. Well, if you're too busy, then why don't you just look at it online?
That's actually possible? Yes. I'll just give you the website so you can see for yourself.
I absolutely love how convenient that is. That's the exact reason why we thought of it.

So what do you think I should do to fix up the interior of my house? A fresh coat of paint is the number one improvement that you can make to your home.
What colors do you think would be best? You need to go with fairly neutral tones. You want fairly contemporary colors that will go with a variety of furnishings.
After paint, what is the next most important improvement that I can make? Remove any extra furnishings and personal items. Make your home look as uncluttered as possible.
Should I get a new carpet? Your carpet is in really good shape. New owners typically want to pick out their own carpeting.
How about improvements to the bathroom? New faucets are not that expensive and can quickly add a clean and more up-to-date look.
What are your suggestions for some inexpensive fixes to help me get the best price for my home? Painting the interior of your home is not that expensive and greatly improves the appearance of your home.
Should I go for trendy colors or more traditional tones? You don't want to make any dramatic statements with paint, but don't go with just white either.
What else can I do besides paint the inside of my home to improve its value? You need to get rid of any extra furniture or knick-knacks.
I need to know if I should replace the carpeting. Your carpeting is very worn. You might want to explore buying some attractive inexpensive carpeting.
How about improvements to the kitchen? You could inexpensively replace the linoleum flooring that would really brighten things up.
What do people usually do to improve the interior of their houses before they sell them? Your house looks very nice on the inside, but a fresh coat of paint always helps brighten a home's interior.
I get confused when trying to pick out colors that other people might like. Lighter neutral colors are usually best. They make rooms appear larger.
The painting suggestion is a good one, but after that, what improvement will add value to my home? Your interior should have only the most basic of furniture. Either store or get rid of any extra clutter.
What about replacing the floor covering? I know that your carpeting is not brand new, but with a good steam cleaning, I think that it will look great.
Is there anything that I can do to the bathrooms and kitchen that wouldn't cost too much? New curtains or blinds do not cost that much and brighten up any room.
What's up? Nothing much, what's going on?
I'm having a party this Friday. Oh, really? That's nice.

What are you going to be doing? My family and I are going to dinner.
I was hoping you would come. I'll definitely try to make it the next time.

What's going on? Nothing really. How about you?
A lot, like the party I'm having on Friday. Well, that's cool.
Will you be able to make it? I'm busy this Friday. I'm sorry.

Excuse me, could you help me figure out how to use this new parking meter? Sure, it was confusing for me also. Have you ever used a regular meter?
Yes, I understood the old one. Well, on this one you can use coins or a debit or credit card which one would you like to use?
Debit or credit card. OK. Now, do you see what the rate is on the sticker?
Yes. OK, now that we know what it will cost, put the money or card into the machine.
Yes, I can do that. Wonderful now, this machine asks you the number of your spot, so put that in also.
Yes, I'm ready. All you have to do now is take your receipt and put it on your dashboard.
Whoa, I never saw a meter like this before how do you use it? It's simple, once you do it a few times. Do you know how the old one worked?
I never used a parking meter before. So we start out by deciding whether you will use cash or a credit or debit card.
Cash. Fine, can you read the rate on the display?
Yes, I can. Fine. Now that we know what they are ripping us off for, insert the payment.
I'd rather not pay, but I have to. Fine, this machine does not ask you the number of your spot, so we can move on, all right?
Perfect, let's do it. Now just check the meter to see how many minutes you have.
This parking meter is really confusing. Can you help me figure it out? It's just like the old one, but with new stuff added.
Yeah, OK. The first step is deciding on debit or credit card payment, so which one is it?
I have coins. Perfect. Now, can you see the rate on the sign?
I didn't see that, but now I do. Once you know what it will cost, put the payment in.
Here it goes! You are doing great! Let's move on to the next step.
I am a little confused. Just make sure that everything registered, and then you are good to go!

You were quite loud. I really didn't mean to be loud.

It's all right, but next time could you try to keep it down? I will try to.
Thank you, because that would be great. You're welcome, and I apologize for the inconvenience.

Hi Julie, how are things going? Everything is great, Tad. How are you?
I'm doing really well. Tad, I'm pretty hungry right now. Want to walk over and check out the food table?
Julie, do you know who that woman is over there by the window? That is Mary. I heard that she's just moved in with Lee.
I thought that he was with Malia. Oh, that relationship is history. Malia hooked up with a guy she met on holiday.
I bet that Lee wasn't too happy with that! Actually, he was OK with it. They hadn't been getting along too well.
Hi Julie, how are you? Things are going good, Tad. How about you?
Things have been going well for me. That food smells delicious! Let's wander over to the food table and see what's up.
Julie, do you know who that woman talking to Lee is? I think that her name is Mary. I think that she and Lee are moving in together.
Isn't he with Malia? Malia dumped him. She ran off with a guy she met on vacation.
Lee was probably less than thrilled with that! He was kind of relieved. They had been having some problems.
Hi Julie, how have things been going for you? I'm good, Tad. How are things with you?
Things couldn't be better right now. Boy, that's quite a spread over on the food table! Let's go check out the party food.
Julie, who is the woman sitting next to Lee on the sofa? Someone told me her name is Mary. Supposedly, she and Lee are living together in Lee's apartment.
What about his relationship with Malia? Malia is no longer in the picture. She moved to Australia to be with a guy she met on vacation.
How did Lee feel about that happening? He took it pretty well. I think that he had kind of had his eye on Mary for a while.

What about their job help information? The office has many wonderful workshops to help you find a job.
Where can I find my local office? Employment Development Offices are listed in the phone book.
Have you ever seen the office that serves our local area? The office is two blocks west of the college on Green Street.
If I show up in person, will I get my money any faster? You have to wait one week before you can collect, regardless of how you file.
Can you help me find out where the EDD office is? There is very little need to go to the Unemployment Office to apply. It can all be done over the Internet or you can phone in to get an application.
I want to make use of their job hotline and the information on the computers. The office has many job listings to help you with your job search.
How do I find out where my local office is located? You can dial information, and the operator can give you the phone number and address of the office.
What is the office that serves our area? I am not sure, but I think that it is in the building on Green Street just west of the college.
I think I might go over there so I will get my money quicker. It doesn't matter if you file online or in person. The wait is still a week for your first check.
Here is your breakfast! Thanks so much. Miss, I believe I ordered my eggs scrambled, and these are fried.
Sorry, your friend over there ordered fried eggs, and I gave you his by mistake. Oh yeah. Here, I will just trade with him.
Here are your pancakes, sir. But I ordered waffles!
I am so sorry! That's OK. I will eat my eggs and bacon, and you can take my pancakes back.
Good, sir. I will take care of that right away. Thank you so much!
I believe you ordered the Grand Slam breakfast. Oh, good! You know, I am looking at my plate and I ordered scrambled eggs, not fried.
I just noticed that I accidentally brought you your friend's breakfast. I can just trade with him, thank you.
And pancakes for you, sir. I am sorry, but I think I ordered waffles.
I am sorry that I misheard you. Just please take my pancakes to trade for waffles. While I am waiting, I will eat my bacon and eggs.
I will get straight back to you with your waffles. I would appreciate that.
One Grand Slam breakfast for you! Thanks. You know, I just noticed that these eggs are fried, and I ordered scrambled.
Thank you for pointing that out. I mistakenly gave you your friend's breakfast. Not a problem. I can just trade my plate with his.
A special order of banana pancakes for you! Pancakes? I don't like pancakes. I ordered waffles.
I am so sorry, sir! I can eat my bacon and eggs while you are exchanging my pancakes for waffles.
I will go trade those pancakes for waffles right now. That would take care of it, thank you.
I need to copy a document immediately. We have a copy machine in our computer lab, located on the first floor.
Great! How much is it for a copy? The price per copy is ten cents.
That sounds reasonable. I'll be down there immediately. THere shouldn't be any long lines, sir.
I need to copy something right now. Our computer lab on the first floor has a copy machine, sir.
Great! How much per copy? Sir, one copy is ten cents.
I'll be down there shortly. You probably won't have to wait for anyone, sir.
I need to make a copy of something at once. There's a copy machine on the first floor in our computer lab, sir.
Fantastic! Is there a charge? It's ten cents a copy, sir.
I'm only making one copy, so I guess I can afford it. A dime is still a bargain, sir.
I need to make a copy of a document as soon as possible. No problem, sir. There's a copy machine in our computer lab.
Very good. How much does each copy cost? Each copy will cost you a dime, sir.
A dime? I remember when copies used to cost a nickel. There aren't many things you can get for a nickel, sir.
Can you tell me where I could make a copy of a document right now? Sir, you can come downstairs right now to the computer lab. 
That's great. I don't suppose the copy machine is free for guests?  Sir, each copy is ten cents or one dime, whichever you prefer. 
In the good old days, it was only five cents a copy. I'll be right down. Those were the good old days, sir, indeed.
I need help preparing for my presentation on Friday. I could help you with that.
Are you sure you have the time? I promise you that I have the time to do this. If I didn't, I wouldn't offer to help.

I'll come prepared. Goodbye until then. I promise you that you'll do well after we meet.
I am a little nervous about my presentation on Friday. If you would like me to, I could help you with that.
Wouldn't that take you away from your project? I have plenty of time to do this. I promise you it won't be a problem for me.
Is there a good time for you to help me? If we work on this tomorrow night, you could easily be ready for Friday.

Hello, how are you doing? Pretty good, and you?
I'm doing great. That's great to hear.
So how long have you been going to PCC? I've been going here for a couple years now. You?
This is my first year. How do you like it so far?
It's all right. You don't like it?
I'll like it better once I finish my GE. That's exactly how I used to feel.
How are things with you? Not too bad. How about yourself?
Not bad. I'm glad to hear that.
Have you been going to PCC long? I've only been here two years. How about yourself?
I just started this year. Do you like it?
It's fine for right now. You do not like it, right?
Once I'm finished with my GE, it should get better. I felt the same way my first year.
How is everything going with you?  Great. You?
Pretty good. Good for you.
When did you start going to PCC? This is my second year. How about you?
I only got here this year. You like it so far?
It's OK. I can tell you don't really like it.
It'll get better after I finish my General Education. I understand what you mean.
Is there anything specific that I should know about where to park my car? You have an assigned place in the back of the building with your apartment number on it.
Are there any other spots available to me? You will see several visitor and unmarked spots. These are available on a first-come basis.
What if there is nothing else available? You can park on the street, but you have to pay attention to the rules.
What are the rules? Most of the laws are posted on the signs, but you also cannot park anywhere on the street between two and six in the morning.

How will I know what the rules are? Just pay attention to street cleaning days and limits on the hours you can park out there.
Are parking citations costly? Yes, parking tickets can be extremely expensive.
Where can I park my car? You have one assigned place right beside your own apartment.
Are there any other open spots available in the parking lot? Your guests can park in a visitor or unmarked spot if one is available.

Do they post the rules anywhere? The rules for parking are all clearly posted. Just follow them and you'll be OK.
Do you have to pay a large fine for a parking ticket? You don't want to get a parking ticket. You have better things to spend your money on!
What do you think about the apartment so far? It is beautiful.
You don't have any problems with how it looks? Actually, there is a problem.
Like what? There are some stains that were left in the carpet.
Those stains will be cleaned out of the carpet before you move in. Oh, is that right?
Yes. Now what other problems do you have? That was the only problem that I saw.
I'm glad that everything else is to your liking. I honestly love it.
Do you like the apartment? I absolutely love the apartment.
Everything is okay? I do have one problem with the apartment.
What's the problem? I don't like all those stains in the carpet.
We will have the carpet cleaned before you move into the apartment. I did not know that.
I assure you that we will, and if there are any more problems, feel free to tell me. That was the only thing that I saw wrong with the apartment.
I'm glad to know that you think the apartment is so nice. It's absolutely incredible. I'll take it.
What are your thoughts on the apartment? I think that it's absolutely gorgeous.
There aren't any problems with the apartment? I think that the apartment looks very nice, but I do see some problems.
What problems? I did notice a few stains in the carpet.

Yes, but other than that, are there any more problems? That was the only thing that I saw that was wrong with the apartment.
I'm happy that you find this apartment so appealing. It is. I love it.
Can you drive me to the airport tomorrow afternoon? I would be happy to drive you to the airport. When do you need to leave?
For an international flight, the airline wants us to check in two hours in advance, so I need to leave my house at 2:00. Do you have a lot of luggage to check in?
I am only carrying one large bag and a carry-on. I'll bring our smaller car then. Do you know where you need to get dropped off?
Yes, I am flying out on Singapore Air to Sydney, so I need to be at the International Terminal. Will I be able to come in with you to say goodbye?
Actually, with airport regulations being so strict, you should probably just drop me off at the curb. That will work out fine. Just give me a call if anything changes.
If you are free, I was wondering if you could give me a ride to the airport this afternoon. Sure, I'll give you a ride. What time do you need to get there?
I need to leave my house at 2:00 so I can get to the airport two hours before my flight. How much luggage are you bringing?
I have my carry-on, a purse, and a large suitcase. I won't have to drive our larger car then. Do you know where your terminal is?
I need to be dropped off on the second level of the International Terminal since I am flying to Sydney on Singapore Air. Do you want me to go in with you at the airport to help you pass the time before you leave?
I would like that, but only ticketed passengers can go into the departure area. I'll drop you off wherever you need to be dropped off. See you later!
Could you help me out with a ride to the airport this afternoon? I can give you a ride with no problem. What is your departure time?
My flight departs at 4:00, so I need to leave my house at 1:00 to get to the airport by 2:00. Are you bringing a lot of bags with you?
I am bringing my purse, a carry-on, and a large suitcase. Your stuff should all fit in my car just fine. Do you know which terminal you are going to?
Since I am flying to Sydney on Singapore Air, I need to be dropped off on the second level of the International Terminal. Can I go inside the airport with you and maybe we can have a drink before you leave?
They only allow ticketed passengers into the departure area, so you'll have to drop me off at the curb. I can take you wherever you need to go. Let me know if there are any changes to your travel plans.
I am here to sign my escrow papers. I will tell you ahead of time, that there is a lot to sign here, but I will help you every step of the way.
Should I have brought anything with me? Basically, what I need from you now is your driver's license or some ID that shows your residency status.
Where do I start? We will be going through these papers one by one. I will be explaining them all to you, and you can ask questions as we go.
Can I make a phone call to a friend if I have a question? We do not want you to sign any documents that you do not understand. You may get assistance with any questions that you have.
Will the house be mine when we finish these documents? This is the last thing you need to do, but it may take a while for the papers to be processed.
Your assistant said that it was time to come in and sign my escrow papers. Don't be intimidated. There is a lot to sign, but I will explain everything to you very clearly.
Do you need anything from me? All the papers have been drawn up, but I will need to see your picture ID so we can notarize these papers.
There are a lot of papers! We are going to go through these bit by bit. You will have plenty of time to read the fine print.
My dad is going to be here in a minute to help me go through this with you. We want you to get any outside help that you need. Do not ever sign documents that you don't understand.
Can I start moving in after I finish signing these documents? When these papers get processed, the house will be yours!
I am very nervous about signing my escrow papers. Escrow involves a lot of paperwork, but I will explain all of the steps to you as we go along.
What should I have brought with me? The only thing I will need to see is your driver's license, as I will be notarizing these papers.
I feel a little overwhelmed by so many papers. Don't worry about how many papers there are. We are going to look at them one at a time.
My boyfriend is an attorney and told me that I could fax him anything if I had a question. Please get any outside help that you need in understanding your escrow documents.
Is this the last thing that I will need to do before the house becomes mine? At the close of escrow, the house will be yours!
I need to use the ATM. What's stopping you?
I'm not sure how. I don't understand.
I've never used one before. I can help you figure it out.
What do I have to do? Slide your card into the machine.
Then what? You need to type your PIN in.
What do I have to do next? Click on whichever option you want, and you're done.
I have to use the ATM. Is there a problem?
I don't know how to use it. What are you talking about?
I have never used an ATM before. I can show you how to use it.
How do I use it? You need to push your card into the machine.
What's next? Enter your PIN.
What else do I have to do? Every option you can choose will appear on the screen. That's about it.
I need to go to the ATM. So, why don't you?
I have no idea how to use the ATM. What do you mean?
This will be my first time using an ATM. I can help you with that.
Explain to me how to use it. Just put your card into the machine.
Now what do I do? Then you need to type in your PIN.
Now what? Just click on one of the choices they give you, and that's it.
It's very nice to meet you. Nice meeting you, too.
I can't believe I'm actually speaking to a candidate. You can ask me questions, if you'd like.
I want to ask you what your policy is on gay marriage. Everyone should be able to love who they want.
Would you make gay marriage legal? I sure would.
I know a lot of people wouldn't agree with that. That's not my problem.
I think that is really cool of you. I'm glad to hear that.
Nice to meet you. It's very nice meeting you, too.
I'm excited to speak to a candidate. What would you like to ask me?
What is your stand on gay marriage? I feel that people can love who they want.
So, would you make gay marriage legal? Of course!
I'm sure plenty of people won't like that. I can't help that.
I like that. I hope so.
It's nice meeting you. It's nice to meet you, too.
I am happy to be speaking to a presidential candidate. Would you like to ask me anything?
What do you feel about gay marriage? I think everyone has the right to love who they want.
Would you legalize gay marriage? Yes, I would.
Many people won't like that. I'm sure they won't, but that's my view on gay marriage.
I really like you. I really appreciate that.
What are you doing here? I'm just shopping.
What are you shopping for? Some new clothes. How about you? 
Same here. Have you found anything nice yet?
I found a few pairs of pants. Where'd you get those?
I found them at JCPennies. Those are really cute.
Do you want me to show you where I found them? I would like that. Thank you.
What are you doing here today? I felt like doing some shopping.
What are you going to buy? I need some new clothes. What about you?
I'm trying tofind some clothes myself. Have you found anything that you like?
I got a new pair of pants. Those are cute. Where'd you get them.
I bought them at JCPennies. I really like those.
I'll show you where to get them at. That would be great.
Funny seeing you here. I'm doing a little bit of shopping.
What are you looking for? I'm looking for new clothes. How about you?
I'm shopping for clothes too. What have you bought so far?
I got these new pants. Where'd you find those at?
I got them at JCPennies. Those are beautiful.
I can show you where to find them, if you'd like. Sure. Thanks a lot.
My assistant called and said that you had received a response to our counteroffer. Yes, the buyers called me just an hour ago.
Did they accept the counteroffer? They came back with their own counteroffer of five thousand less than you wanted.
What do you think about their offer? I think that this is a good offer. They also would like to have a 90-day escrow to allow them to sell their home. 
The length of the escrow is not a huge issue with us. They also want the sale contingent on a good building inspection.
That is reasonable, and I accept those conditions. I will let them know that you have accepted their counteroffer. They will be very pleased!
I had a message on my phone that the buyers had responded to our counteroffer. Yes, the response just came through on the fax machine.
Was the counteroffer acceptable to them? They made their own counteroffer of five thousand less than you proposed.
Do you feel that their counteroffer is reasonable? Their offer is a good one. They also want to have a short escrow as they have already sold their home and are ready to move in.
We can accommodate the buyer's desire for an escrow length of their choosing. They want their building inspector to approve the quality of the house.
I would expect that to be the case and accept their counteroffer. I will contact the buyers immediately and let them know of your acceptance of their counteroffer. I am sure they will be excited!
I was calling in to see if there had been any response from the buyers regarding my counteroffer. Yes, the buyer's agent just contacted me while I was at an Open House.
Did they state whether the counteroffer worked for them or not? They almost accepted your counteroffer price but want to go a little lower. They are offering five thousand less than your counteroffer.
In your professional opinion, is this a good offer? Personally in today's market, I would accept the offer. They also want a short escrow as they feel that interest rates are low right now. 
We can either lengthen or shorten the escrow for the buyer. They want to make sure that the inspector says that there are no major problems with the house before this is a solid deal.
Of course, the house will have to pass a basic inspection, but we accept their counteroffer. The buyers will be happy to hear that you have accepted their counteroffer.
Can you help me with my timesheet? Sure! I can help you. Do you know where the timesheets are kept?
No, I don't know where to find one. Well, once you get one off the shelf over there, you first put your name on it. OK?
Yes, I can do that. Now you have to fill in the hours in the blanks and total the hours for the week. Do you know how to use military time?
No, I don't know what that is. OK, so we just start counting hours at midnight and record it. Show all minutes as a dot and then write how many minutes. OK?
Yes, I understand how to do this. After you total your hours, make sure you sign it and turn it in to your supervisor.
That was easy! Good luck and let me know if you need any help later on.
How do we do timesheets here? They are actually fairly straightforward. Do you know where the blanks are kept?
Yes, I already have one. OK, well after you take one out of that second drawer, you put your name on the top. Do you see?
I am kind of confused. Next you fill in all of your hours for each day and total them. Do you know how to show time on a 24-hour clock?
I'm not quite sure. Midnight is zero and when you put the minutes in, make sure that you show them with a dot followed by the minutes. Do you understand?
No, I have no idea what you are talking about. It's easy, just write in the hours, total it, sign it, and put it in the box.
Thanks for your help. Try it and if you can't do it, one of us can always help you later.
I need help with my timesheet. OK, no problem. Have you found the blank ones?
Yes, I have seen them. Yes, well put your name on it after you have downloaded it off the company website. OK?
Yes, I understand what to do. You fill in the hours and total them for the week. Have you ever used a 24 hour clock?
What? Huh? So after you noted the hours, starting at zero which is midnight, you just write down the minutes as a dot followed by minutes. Get it?
Huh? What? Just make sure you show your total, sign it, and turn it in.
I thought you said this was easy. You are a quick learner. I don't think you'll have any trouble with this.

Then what should I do? You will stand over here up against this plate.
Should I just stand naturally? You will raise your arms up shoulder high.
Is this all right? Yes, you are doing great.
Where will you be going? I need to stand behind this shield. Now you will take a deep breath, hold it, and let it out.
Is that it? That's it. You can get dressed when the film is developed.

Mary, it's good to see you! Josh and I were just on our way back home from the beach and thought we'd drop by.
I am so glad that you decided to stop by! Yes, it has been a long time since we have seen you.
Mary, can I get Josh or you something to drink? Oh no, thank you. We aren't all that thirsty.
How about a little snack then? No, thank you, we just ate lunch a little while ago.
Well then, how is your family? Everyone is doing great. My sister finally had her baby.
Mary, what a surprise! I am so glad you are home! Josh and I thought that we'd take a chance and stop by for a visit. 
Your timing is perfect! It's been a long time since we've stopped by.
Mary, Josh, would either of you like something to drink? Thanks, but we really are fine.
Would you like a little snack? No, thanks. We are still full from lunch.
Is your family doing well? Things are going well for everyone. My brother finally got the job he had been trying for.
Mary, how have you been? Josh and I just took a chance on our way home from the beach to see if you were up for visitors.
I was just thinking about you yesterday! It's been ages since we had a chance to visit with you!
Mary, please let me get the two of you something to drink. Oh, please don't go to any trouble. We just stopped by for a visit.
Can I get you a little something to eat? We appreciate the offer, but we already ate.
So tell me, how is your family doing? We are all doing well. My dad finally got to retire and is enjoying his leisure time.
So, during the time that you are showing my house, how will my valuables be protected? Our real estate company takes every precaution to see that your valuables are protected at all times.
How will I know when someone will be looking at my home? We will typically give you at least 4 hours notice on a weekend before we come by.
Will you always accompany whoever is looking at my house? Your house is listed on the multiple listing. That means that people from a variety of real estate offices will be showing your home. 
How will the realtors get into my house if I am not at home? We put a lockbox on your house. The realtors will have a key to the lockbox and then they can get a key to your front door.
What about people watching my stuff during an Open House? We always suggest that you either store your jewelry in a safe or move it into a friend's house while your house is being shown.
I am worried about the security of my home while it is being shown. We do everything we can to protect your home and your valuables
Do people just come and look whenever they want to? During the week, we will let you know the night before if we will be bringing someone by the next day.
I am assuming that someone from your office will always be there, right? Your home is listed exclusively with our office. We will be the only ones showing your home.
Does everyone have a copy of my house key? Realtors have a special key to what is called a lockbox. Once they get into the lockbox, they can get a key to the house.
I have heard horror stories from friends about being ripped off during their Open House. Our company has invested in several cameras that we place in the key rooms while the house is being shown.
I have heard horror stories about people's things being stolen while their house is being shown. We have a very good track record when it comes to home security.
I am not so sure that I like the idea of people showing up whenever they want to pop in! We will always call at least 12 hours in advance if we are bringing someone by to see your home.
Are you the only one showing my house? To get maximum exposure and a variety of buyers, your home is listed on the multiple listing. Many different realtors will be showing your home.
Do you have to come and let the different realtors in when they come to look at my house? The realtors can get a key to your house by unlocking a lockbox on your front door. They use it while they are there and return it when they leave.
The thing I worry about the most is having my valuables stolen during an Open House. Our realtors try to be very aware at all times of who is in the house and what they are doing.
I can't find my purse! What was in your purse?
It contained my wallet and passport. How much money was in your wallet?
There was about $200 in my wallet, and I had some traveler's checks in there, too. We can call American Express to deal with the traveler's checks. How about credit cards?
I had a MasterCard and a Visa Card. We can look at the back of my cards to get the emergency phone numbers.
Where do I report that my passport is missing? We need to take a cab to the embassy to report that right away. They will help us.
I think that someone stole my purse! What did you have in your purse?
Both my wallet and my passport were in there. Did you have a lot of money in your wallet?
Fortunately there was only a little change and some traveler's checks. Did you have any credit cards in your wallet? We need to report them as well as the traveler's checks.
I only had a Visa Card in my wallet. We can call the front desk to get the lost or stolen card phone numbers.
I am worried about reporting my passport as missing. The embassy can help us. We should walk over there and they can advise us on what we can do about replacing your passport.
I left my purse in the taxi! Can you remember what you had in your purse?
I had my wallet and my passport in that purse. How much cash was in your wallet?
Most of my money was in traveler's checks with just a little amount in cash. Do you know what credit cards you had in your wallet? We can call and report those as well as your traveler's checks.
I had an American Express Card and a Visa Card in my wallet. We can call the information number to get the phone numbers for lost or stolen cards.
Do you know how to report a missing passport? We need to contact the embassy right away. They will be able to help you replace your passport.
So tell me again, why couldn't you get the supplies I ordered? Well I ordered them when you asked, but the supplier said they might need to back order them.
When do you think they will finally arrive? I think maybe by Tuesday.
If they don't arrive by then, what are our options? I could try another supplier down the street.
That would work for me. OK, I will stay on it and let you know how it's going.
Thank you for taking care of the problem. Thank you for your business. We appreciate you as a client.
You promised me the supplies would be in today and now you say they aren't here? They said they had part of the order, but the rest won't be available until later.
I guess that's it then, when will you be able to get the rest? I am not sure.
I am not convinced that will work for me, what now? I could order them from another supplier as a back-up.
That is a good plan. Good! I will call you later this afternoon and let you know when your supplies will arrive.
I appreciate you staying on it. We appreciate your business and aim to please.
I really needed the supplies today and you are telling me you don't have them? The supplier said that it will be a few more days until they can ship the order.
Fine, what day will the whole order be here? If we are lucky, they may get here tomorrow.
Is there anywhere else we can get these supplies? Let's order the missing items from someone else just to be sure.
I appreciate that suggestion. I will track your order on the internet and e-mail you the moment it arrives.
I look forward to hearing from you. Please let me know if there is anything else I can do for you in the meantime.
Have you seen the new girl in school? No, I haven't.
She's really pretty. Describe her to me.
She's not too tall. Well, how tall is she?
She's about five feet even. What does she look like, though?
She has pretty light brown eyes. I may know which girl you're talking about.
So you have seen her around? Yes, I have.
There's a new girl in school, have you seen her yet? I haven't seen her yet.
I think that she is very pretty. Tell me how she looks.
She's kind of short. What height is she?
She's probably about five feet. That's nice, but tell me what she looks like.
The first thing I noticed was her beautiful brown eyes. I think I might've bumped into her before.
Are you telling me that you've seen her before? I believe so.
Have you met the new girl? No. Have you?
She's one of the prettiest girls at the school. What does she look like?
Well, she's quite short. How tall would you say that she is?
I would say she's only five feet. What about her facial features?
She has light brown eyes, absolutely beautiful. I think I know who you're talking about.
Have you seen her? I think that I have.
Is this Mr. Wallace? Yes, this is Mr. Wallace.
Mr. Wallace, this is the Xenon Company. Oh, hello, how are you doing?
Mr. Wallace, we were very pleased with your interview and would like to offer you the position. Wonderful! I am very happy to be able to join your organization.
We are interested in having you begin as soon as possible, perhaps in two weeks? Yes, that would be perfect!
Good morning, may I speak with Mr. Wallace, please? You are speaking to him, may I help you?
Mr. Wallace, this is the Xenon Company calling to speak with you. Yes, good to hear from you!
We are calling you today to offer you the job you interviewed for last week. That's great! I am looking forward to working for you.
Would you be able to begin working for us in two weeks? I could begin working then with no problem.
This is Jason Brack calling, is Mr. Wallace in? Yes, how may I help you?
I am calling you from the Xenon Company. Yes, I was hoping to hear from you!
You had great interview and we are pleased to be able to offer you a position. Excellent. I will consider it an honor to join your organization.
Would two weeks from now be a good start date for you? That would be great. I could give notice to my current job and start with you on that date.
I was wondering if I could collect unemployment benefits. Did you get laid off?
I am still working for now, but I might get laid off. You may collect unemployment if you are working fewer hours or got laid off.
Does everyone who gets laid off get to collect unemployment? No, some jobs are exempt from paying into unemployment.
How can I find out if I can collect? Your employer can tell you if you have been paying into unemployment and now qualify to collect.
How will I know how much I can collect on unemployment? It depends on how much you earned. When you file, they will determine the amount.
Can I collect unemployment benefits? Are you still working?
My employer cut back on my hours. If you got laid off or are working a lot fewer hours, you may qualify.
Do I definitely get to collect unemployment? Not all jobs pay into unemployment insurance, so their employees cannot collect benefits.
How do I check out my status to collect unemployment? You should have noticed unemployment insurance being deducted from your paycheck. Check your pay stubs.
How much will my unemployment check be? The more money you made, the more you will earn on unemployment. They have a formula.
How do I know if I qualify for unemployment benefits? Are you working fewer hours than you used to work?
I got laid off. You usually qualify if you got laid off or are working a lot fewer hours.
Do all jobs provide unemployment? Most jobs provide unemployment, but some don't.
Do you think that my job pays unemployment? You can call your unemployment office, and they can check for you.
Will I be able to collect a lot of money on unemployment? There is a formula to determine the amount based on how much you earned. They will let you know when you file your claim.
I have a problem. What's the problem?
My mattress was supposed to be delivered today. Is there a problem?
The delivery people showed up four hours late. I apologize for their tardiness.
I was late for work because of them. Again, I do apologize for the inconvenience.
I want my money back for the delivery. Seeing as they were late, that won't be a problem.
It shouldn't be a problem. I'm going to refund your money right now.
I'm having a problem. What can I help you with?
I was supposed to have my mattress delivered today. Was there a problem with the delivery?
The delivery people were four hours late. I do apologize.
Since I had to wait for them, I was late for work. I am really sorry about that.
I need my money back. I can do that for you. That won't be a problem.
I know it shouldn't be a problem. I'm getting your money right now.
I have an issue. What is it?
I had scheduled a delivery for today. So, what is the problem?
The delivery was four hours late. I'm so sorry for them being late.
I was late for work, because I had to wait up for them. I do apologize.
I would like to be refunded my money for the delivery. You will be refunded for the delivery. It'll be no problem.
I shouldn't have to pay for such horrible service. I'll refund you your money right away.
I heard that you're looking for an apartment. Yes. Who told you that?
A friend of ours told me. Why are you asking?
I was asking because I found an apartment. Why are you telling me this?
I was wondering if you wanted to sublease with me. I sure would!
Since we're subleasing, we can each pay half of the rent. How much is the rent each month?
It's $1000 a month. That's wonderful.
Are you still looking for an apartment? Who said I was?
One of our friends let me know. Why'd you want to know?
I found an apartment for lease. So what?
I wanted to know if you would sublease the apartment with me. That would be great!
That's great, because this way we can go halves on the rent. What's rent?
It's $1,000 each month, but it'll only cost us $500 a month each. I like the sound of that.
Is it true that you're looking for an apartment? I am. How'd you know?
I heard it from one of our friends. Well then, why do you ask if I'm looking for an apartment?
I was thinking about leasing this apartment. What does this have to do with me?
Would you like to sublease the apartment with me? I would love to!
This way, we'll each have to pay only half the rent. How much is the rent?
For each of us, it's $500 every month. Sounds good to me.
I heard that the potential buyer is interested in me carrying part of a loan for him. Carrying part of a loan can be a good or a bad thing, depending on the circumstances.
What would be an advantage of me carrying a note on the house? If you don't need the money right away, you can earn a fairly good interest rate.
Why does my buyer want me to carry part of his loan? In this economy, buyers sometimes have trouble getting a loan even when they have good credit.
What are the risks to me? The risk is that the market could drop drastically and the owner would walk away.
How long will I need to commit to financing this loan? You need to make an agreement with the buyer as to how long you will carry this note.
My potential buyer has asked me to carry part of his loan. The decision to carry part of a loan might be advantageous to you or problematic.
Why would I ever want to carry a note on a house? It is a type of investment that can offer a fairly steady return over a set period of time.
Why is my buyer requesting that I carry part of his loan? Oftentimes buyers are well able to afford the home but unable to qualify for a loan.
Are there any risks in carrying a second mortgage? You are basically betting on the fact that the home is not going to drastically fall in price. This could leave you with a house that is not worth much.
Will I be financing this loan for a set period of time? That is entirely up to you and the buyer.
If the purchaser of your home wants you to carry part of the loan, is that good? Carrying a loan could be good or bad for you as a seller.
Why would it be a good thing to carry a note on my own house? For investors who can afford to have their money tied up, it can offer a fairly nice return.
What advantage is my buyer looking for in having me carry him on paper? We are seeing more and more buyers who are not able to qualify for a loan and are able to take out a second mortgage with the owner.
Can I lose my money if I carry a second mortgage? It is an investment and carries some risks. You are counting on the housing market to not go into a tailspin.
Is there a certain amount of time that I will be carrying this loan? The buyer and seller set the year for the loan to come due.
Hello, it's nice to meet you. It's great meeting you too.
Did you just move in? I moved in this past weekend.
I had no idea that house was sold. I had to buy. The first time I saw it, I fell in love.
It is a beautiful house. Have you been living here long?
About 20 years now. Wow! That's a long time.
Hopefully we will be neighbors for a lot longer. I love this house too much to ever move.
It is very nice meeting you. I'm happy to meet you also.
When did you get moved in? Just this past weekend.
I didn't even know the house got sold. I absolutely love this house, so I had to buy it.
I understand, because the house is extraordinary. How many years have you been living in your house?
I've been living here for over 20 years. Twenty years? That is a very long time.
I hope that we remain neighbors for a while longer. I could never move out of this house.
Hey, nice to meet you. It's nice to meet you too.
When exactly did you move into the house? I finished moving in this last weekend.
I didn't realize that the house was bought. Yeah, I saw the house and just fell in love with it.
It was impossible to pass up. So, how long have you been living here?
Twenty years and counting. That's great to hear.
I sure hope that you stay here for that long. I'd be crazy to ever move out.
I need to see if I qualify for a home loan. I can help you. How much money do you make per year?
I make around one hundred thousand dollars per year. How long have you been on your current job?
I have only worked at this job for 6 months, but I have a longer job history elsewhere. Do you have any other outside income from rental property or a trust?
No, I only receive my salary. Do you know your credit score?
I think that it is around 600. By crunching the numbers and putting in your expenses, I estimate that you can afford a house of around five hundred thousand dollars.
I am trying to see if I can afford to purchase a home that I wish to buy. We can figure that out right now. How much do you earn annually?
My wife and I earned one hundred and fifty thousand dollars last year. How many years have you held your current position?
I have been at my current job for 10 years. Is there any extra income that you receive other than salary?
I collect one thousand dollars a month from a rental property. Have you ever figured out your credit score?
I try not to think about it! Adding in your expenses, I calculate that you can spend three hundred thousand on a house.
I want to go house shopping, and I want to know what I can afford to buy. There is a formula that can help us figure that out. What is your annual salary?
I earn sixty-five thousand dollars per year. What is the length of time that you have worked at the job you have now?
I have been at the job I now have for 2 years, and I have been with the company for 6 years total. Do you receive any other income?
I own a small rental unit with a partner, and I receive five hundred dollars a month from that unit. Do you know what your credit score is?
I don't know, but the last time I checked, it was very good! You are in good shape. Figuring in your other expenses, you can easily afford a house costing seven hundred thousand or maybe even a little more!
Hi, Tom. This is Hannah from apartment 4C. Oh, hi, Hannah.
There is something wrong with my garbage disposal. Exactly what's going on?
When I turn on the disposal switch, all I get is silence. When did this happen?
Well, about a week ago is when it started sounding strange. Did you accidentally drop something in the disposal?
No. I only use it about once a week. I hardly ever put anything into it. Actually, I've heard that too little use is bad for a disposal.
Well, no one ever told me that. Did you try to turn it with the disposal key?
I don't have a key. Well, I've got a spare key, so I'll come over to show you how to use it.
Okay, come on over now, and show me how to use it. If the key doesn't work, I'll have to call the repairman.
Well, if it doesn't work, it's no big deal. Yes, but if something's broken, I like to get it fixed ASAP.
Tom, are you there? It's Hannah from 4C. Hey, Hannah. Long time no hear from.
My garbage disposal refuses to work. What happens when you turn on the switch?
When I turn on the switch, nothing happens. When did you first notice this?
A week ago it started sounding different. Did you put something in it that you shouldn't have?
I use it rarely. When I do use it, I put pasta or other soft food into it. Maybe you haven't been using the disposal enough.
Sort of like an air conditioner in your home or car? Exactly. However, sometimes you can get it going again by using the key.
What key? A disposal key. I've got a spare one, so I'll come over to show you.
Okay, come on over now, and show me how to use it. If the key doesn't correct the problem, I'll have to call someone.
Well, like I said, I rarely use it so it won't be a problem. Well, it's my nature to fix things as soon as I can.
Is anybody home? It's me--Hannah. Hey, Hannah. How's everything going?
My garbage disposal isn't working. Can you be a little more specific?
Nothing happens when I turn on the switch. Do you remember how it started?
about a week ago I noticed a new sound. You didn't drop a fork or anything into it, did you?
I don't use it very often. When I do use it, I put only soft food into it. I've heard that disposals need to be run frequently.
That's interesting. I never heard that before. Have you tried to turn it manually using the key?
I don't have a key, and I wouldn't know how to use it. I've got an extra key. I'll show you how to use it.
I'm always willing to learn something new. Come on over. The key might not work. Then I'll have to call the plumber.
If it works or doesn't work, it doesn't matter much to me. Yes, but I prefer to fix things now instead of later.
Hello, Tom? This is Hannah in 4C. Hi, Hannah. What can I do for you?
My garbage disposal went south. Does it turn at all?
There is nothing but silence when I turn on the switch. Did it die suddenly?
It started to make a weird sound last week. You didn't try to grind up a dead body, did you?
No, that's against the law, isn't it? I only use it on soft food, maybe once a week. Strange as it seems, a disposal should be run frequently.
Once a week might not be enough, huh? There's a key that will turn it manually to loosen it up.
Even if I could find this key, I wouldn't know how to use it. How about if I bring one over and show you how to use it?
Great, come on over, and teach me all about garbage disposal keys. The key isn't a guarantee. I still might have to call a repairman.
It's no big deal to me if you can fix it or not. Well, we don't want the food that's in there to start to smell bad, do we?
Hi, Tom. This is Hannah calling. Hi, Hannah. What's up?
I think my garbage disposal kicked the bucket. Is it dying, or is it dead?
Turning on the switch is the same as not turning on the switch. Did it make strange sounds before it croaked?
Last week I noticed that it sounded strange. You haven't been putting mango or avocado seeds in there, have you?
I use the disposal rarely. When I do use it, I put only soft food into it. I think a disposal freezes up when it's not used frequently.
You mean it's sort of like use it or lose it? Try loosening it up by using the disposal key.
Disposal key? I have a house key and a car key, but no disposal key. Well, I've got an extra key. I'll bring it over.
Okay, Come on over, and show me how to fix this thing. Sometimes the key works, sometimes it doesn't. I still might have to call a plumber.
Well, there's no big hurry, as far as I am concerned. If we don't fix it sometime, your apartment might start to attract bugs or rodents.
What can I help you with today? I have a problem.
What is the problem? I wrote a check for $100 and it bounced.
Do you have enough money in your account? I think so.
Let me check that for you right now. Okay. Thank you.
Apparently there is only $57 left in your account. You can't be serious!
That's what my records show. I see. Thanks for your help.
How may I help you? There's a problem with my check.
What problem? My check for $100 bounced.
Are you sure you have $100 in your checking account? I thought I did.
I'll check for you. Thank you very much.
It looks like you only have $57 left in your account. That can't be right!
That's what my computer is showing. All right. Thank you very much.
What can I do for you? I have a problem with this check.
What's wrong? I wrote out a check for $100 and it bounced.
Do you have enough money in your checking account? I believe so.
Give me a moment, and I'll check. All right. Thanks.
You only have $57 left in your checking account. That's impossible.
I'm sorry, but that's what our records show. Okay. Thanks. Have a nice day.
I received an eviction notice from you, and I don't understand what it means. Well, you are behind in your rent it's a 30-day notice to vacate.
You can't make me move just for being late with my rent. You have been late with your rent several times now. I am filing suit for back rent to protect myself.
Are you throwing me out? This notice is to let you know that you will be evicted by a sheriff if you don't make good on your rent.
If I catch up on my rent, can I stay? You can stay if you catch up and stay caught up. Otherwise, I will find another renter.
I will go get the money right now. Thank you. Please make sure that you pay with cash or a cashier's check.
I opened my mail, found this eviction notice, and don't know what to do with it. Actually, it is a 30-day notice to vacate the premises.
Just for being a few days late? This isn't the first time you have been considerably late with the rent. I need to start the procedure to evict you.
Are you taking my apartment away? This is a notice to inform you that the sheriff will evict you in 30 days if you do not pay up on your rent.
Can I keep the apartment if I pay my rent in full? You can keep the apartment if you stay caught up on your rent. Otherwise, I need to find someone who can make the payments.
I will go write a check right now. Thank you. I will need a cashier's check or cash, please.
What is this eviction notice for? The notice you received is a 30-day notice to vacate.
Are you kidding me? I mentioned to you before that you need to keep up with your rent. This notice to evict is letting you know that I mean business.
You can't just throw me out on the street! You have 30 days to catch up on your rent, or a sheriff will evict you.
Will you still throw me out if I make the rent payment? You can stay, but you might think about looking for a less expensive living arrangement if you are having trouble making the payments.
I am going to take care of the rent payment right now. Thank you. The payment needs to be in the form of cash or a cashier's check.
I am so excited! Excited about what?
I just voted. Is this the first time you've voted?
Yes, I just had my 18th birthday this year. That's lucky.
Why is that? You turned 18 in an election year.
I didn't think about it like that. Really?
No, but that makes me even more excited. You're a part of history.
I am really excited! Why are you so excited?
I just got done voting. This was your first time voting, wasn't it?
I just turned 18 last month. That is so lucky of you.
Why? You turned 18 a month before the election.
I didn't think of it that way. Are you serious?
Seriously, but I'm excited that I did. Congratulations on being a part of history.
Can you tell that I'm excited? What are you excited about?
I voted today. Was this your first time?
I just turned 18 a month ago. You're lucky.
What do you mean? Because you turned 18 in an election year.
I didn't even think of that. You didn't?
I really didn't, but I'm still excited. You should be, because you're a part of history.
What are you calling about today? I scheduled a delivery for tomorrow.
Is there a problem? I would like to reschedule.
That shouldn't be a problem. Can I have it delivered the day after tomorrow?
So, you want it delivered the day after tomorrow? Yes, will that be possible?
What time would you like us to deliver it? Is 2:30 okay?
Your delivery has been confirmed. Thank you, and I'm sorry for the change of plans.
How may I help you? I was going to have a mattress delivered to my house.
What's the problem? I need to have it delivered another day.
That won't be a problem. I need to have it delivered two days from today.
You want it delivered in two days? Is that okay?
What time do you want it delivered? I would like it delivered at 2:30.
I have changed your delivery to that day and time. Thank you for your help.
What can I do for you? I was supposed to have my mattress delivered tomorrow.
Is something wrong? I need to reschedule the delivery.
I can help you with that. I won't be home tomorrow, so I need it done the next day.
In two days? Yes, that's when I need it done.
At what time? I need it at about 2:30.
Alright, you're all set with your delivery. That's great! I appreciate your help.
I have no idea what to buy for Mary for her birthday. Me, neither! Would you like to go in and buy her a gift together?
Yes, that would be good! We need to think about what she might like. What are her interests?
If I remember right, she likes music, skiing, and reading. You know, maybe we could get her some concert tickets. Who would know her favorite groups?
Her roommate, Malia, might know what her favorite groups are. Yeah, Malia would be able to help us choose a concert.
Let's give Malia a call and ask her for her help right now. Good! Maybe Malia would like to go in with us on this gift.
I can't figure out what to get Mary for her birthday. I am having a problem figuring that out myself. Do you want to pick something out together?
Yes, that way we would have more money to spend. She has a lot of interests. What things do you think she likes to do the best?
Well, she really likes going hiking, listening to music, and travel. The music idea sounds good. I wonder who knows what concerts she might like to go to?
Maybe we could ask her roommate, Malia, who her favorite groups are. Malia would be a great help. She has known Mary a long time.
Let's e-mail Malia and ask her for her suggestions. I think that maybe Malia might like to contribute to this gift too.
I have been trying hard to pick out a cool gift for Mary for her birthday. That's been challenging for me too. Would you like to go in with me and choose something together?
Yes, two heads are better than one. What does she like to do? That might help us pick something out.
She seems to really enjoy music, getting pedicures, and going to the movies. Maybe we could get her some concert tickets. Do you know who might know what concert she might like to go to?
I think that her roommate, Malia, could give us some suggestions. Malia definitely could help us. She knows Mary very well.
I am going to see Malia this afternoon after class and ask her what she thinks. That will work out well. Perhaps Malia would like to help buy this gift.
I want something sweet after dinner. What do you have in mind?
A dessert sounds nice. What kind are you thinking of getting?
I want to get some pie. What kind of pie do you want?
I have no idea. Do you want to know what kind of pie I like?
Sure, what kind do you like? I love apple pie.
I love apple pie too. There you go. Problem solved.
I have a sweet tooth. What exactly do you want?
I would love to get some dessert. What did you want to get?
I'd love to get a pie. What kind do you want to get?
I'm not sure. I can tell you what kind I like.
What kind do you like? Apple pie is my favorite.
I love apple pie too. See, I helped you out.
I have a taste for something sweet. What are you thinking?
I want some kind of dessert. Well, what kind of dessert do you want?
I was thinking about ordering some kind of pie. Do you know what kind you want?
I honestly don't know. Did you want to know my favorite kind of pie?
What's your favorite kind? My absolutely favorite kind of pie is apple.
That sounds really good to me right now. I'm happy to help.
I need a suggestion for a restaurant here in Manhattan. Certainly! How much are you planning to spend on dinner, sir?
My date's very sophisticated, so I'm sure she would expect nothing but the best. May I suggest our own hotel restaurant? It got three stars in the latest restaurant review.
No, thank you, I want to go out on the town. What other ideas do you have? There's always Gramercy Tavern. They have live jazz. The food is delicious, but very expensive.
That sounds like a good place to take a date. Can you make a reservation for me? As you wish, sir. You'll have a wonderful time there.
Can you tell me about a nice restaurant to go to? Of course! How much would you like to spend on your meal?
My date is quite sophisticated. She would expect nothing less than the best. Well, how about our own hotel restaurant? It's conveniently located and has a three-star rating.
That's a good idea, except I want to go out, not stay in. Something else, maybe? Well, how about Gramercy Tavern? It's a very popular tourist spot, with great food and music.
That sounds good! Could you call them to see if I can get a reservation? Of course, sir. You've made a good choice.
So, now I need your help again, if you don't mind. I'm taking a date to a restaurant. I'd love to help you! What is your budget for the dinner?
She strikes me as being very sophisticated. Only the best will do for her. Well, what do you think about our very own hotel restaurant? It is very upscale, with a three-star rating.
I don't want to be cooped up in my own hotel tonight. How about another restaurant? The Gramercy Tavern is highly rated. It has great food and live jazz, but it's not cheap.
Yes, that sounds like a winner. Would you please call them to reserve a table? I'm already dialing, sir.
I'm taking a date to a restaurant, so could you please direct me to a good one? But of course! How much are you thinking of spending on dinner?
She deserves nothing but the best, of course. In that case, I would suggest our own hotel restaurant. The chef, the food, and the service are outstanding.
I promised her I would take her out to a restaurant. Do you have another one in mind? You can always go to Gramercy Tavern. It's quite popular, despite its expensive entrees. 
Great food and lots of patrons? What more could I want? Please reserve a table for me. Yes, sir. You're going to have a great time.
I'm taking my date to a restaurant. Could you tell me about one or two good ones? My pleasure! How much would you like to spend on your date?
She will want an excellent restaurant, of course. You should know that our hotel chef was trained in Paris. The service and food are world-class.
I wanted to go out somewhere, not stay here. Do you know of another good restaurant? You can't go wrong with Gramercy Tavern. It's famous for its food, service, and live jazz.
I like that! Could you please call them to see if we can get in tonight? At once, sir. You'll love this place, I assure you.
Well, I've got a date. Now I need to find a restaurant. Can you help me? No problem, of course! How much would you like to spend to impress the lady?
Nothing but the best for a pretty woman! Sir, the restaurant you seek is right here. This hotel has a three-star restaurant.
I sort of suggested that we would go out on the town. Do you have another suggestion? Gramercy Tavern is at least as good as our own hotel restaurant. Plus, they have live jazz.
Gramercy Tavern? I think I've heard of that before. Call to get us a table, okay? Right away, sir. She will be impressed with your local knowledge.
Hello, how are you doing today? I'm great.
What can I do for you today? I wanted to ask about the apartment for rent.
Ask away. I was wondering if the apartment is located in a nice area.
As a matter of fact, the apartment is in a wonderful location. What surrounds the apartment?
There are many stores and restaurants surrounding the apartment. Is that right?
I promise you that you will love the location. From what you're telling me, it sounds like I will.
How are you? Good, thank you.
What can I help you with? Can I ask you a few questions about the apartment?
Ask whatever you'd like. I want to know if the location of the apartment is nice.
I honestly believe that you will love the location. What kinds of places are around the apartment?
Surrounding the apartment are great places to eat and stores to shop at. Oh, really?
I'm sure that the location will be to your liking. I hope that you're right.
How is everything with you today? I'm fine. Thank you for asking.
Can I help you with something? I actually have a few questions about the apartment.
What questions do you have? Is this apartment in a nice location?
It is in a great location. Are there any stores near the apartment?
You will find many stores and restaurants near the apartment. Really?
I guarantee that the apartment is in a beautiful location. That sounds wonderful.
Can I ask you some questions about the in-flight instructions? I would be happy to help you clarify anything you need help with.
Could you help me find out where my nearest exit is? There is a card in your seat pocket that shows you where your nearest exit is. Yours is two rows in front of you.
Where is my oxygen mask that you were talking about? Your oxygen mask is above you, next to the reading light. It will drop down when you need it.
I am concerned about landing in the water. The life jackets are under your seat. You can also use your seat cushion as a flotation device.
What is the most important thing we can do to stay safe? The most important thing you can do is keep your seatbelt fastened when the captain asks you to.
I am kind of confused about the in-flight instructions and need to ask you a few questions. It would be my pleasure to help you with any questions you might have.
Where is that card that shows my nearest exit? That card is in the seat pocket right in front of you. Your nearest exit is directly behind you.
Is my oxygen mask up here? Your oxygen mask will drop down if we lose cabin pressure. 
Do we have any life jackets on this plane if we need them? Your seat cushion can be used as a flotation device and your life jacket is under the seat cushion.
It seems really windy outside. The wind won't be a problem. Always make sure that your seatbelt is fastened when you are requested to fasten it.
Would it be all right if I asked you a few questions about your in-flight instructions? I would love to help clarify any questions you might have.
When you were talking about the nearest exit, what were you talking about? There's a card in this seat pocket that shows you where your nearest exit is. Your nearest exit is right here.
What if I need an oxygen mask? The oxygen mask is above you and will drop down if you need it.
Where are the life jackets? You will find your life jacket under your seat if you need it. Also, you have a seat cushion that can be used as a flotation device.
If I want to be safe, what can I do? Keep your seatbelt fastened at all times. If you fall asleep, keep it fastened loosely around you in case we hit turbulence unexpectedly.
I'm so thirsty. Let's go get something to drink.
That's a good idea. Do you know what you want to drink?
I kind of want a soda. You shouldn't drink soda when you're really thirsty.
What do you mean? When you're thirsty, you're not supposed to drink soda.
What are you supposed to drink? Water is what's best for you.
I guess I will get water. It's better for you.
I am really thirsty. How about we go and get something to drink?
Let's do that. Do you know what you want to get?
A soda sounds good. Soda isn't the best thing to drink when you're thirsty.
Why is that? Soda isn't good for you.
What should I drink then? You should really drink water.
That sounds good. It's a lot better than soda.
My throat is really dry. Do you want to go get something to drink?
Yes, I'm parched. What did you want to drink?
I was thinking about getting a soda. Do you know that soda doesn't quench your thirst?
Why not? Soda is really bad for you.
I don't know what else to drink. You're supposed to drink water when you're dehydrated.
I would like some water. That's what will keep you from being thirsty.
Hey, what's up? Nothing really.
I'm throwing a party on Friday. I didn't realize that.
You didn't? Nobody has told me anything about your party.
Did you want to go? When does it start?
At 8:00 p.m. I'll be there.
I'd better see you there. Of course.
What's going on with you? Fine. What's going on with you?
I'm having a party this Friday. I had no idea.
Is that right? I didn't hear anything about it.
Can you go? What time?
It starts at 8 o'clock. I'll go.
I hope that I'll see you there. No doubt.
What's going on? Not much.
This Friday, I'm throwing a party. Oh really? I didn't know that.
Are you serious? I haven't heard anything about it.
Can you make it? What time does it start?
The party starts at 8. Yeah, I think I'll go.
Am I going to see you there? You will.
Welcome, Ron, come on in! Hi, Malia! What a nice home!
We enjoy it too! How long have you lived here?
About four years now. Well, it is very beautiful.
Ron, have a seat and I'll get us something to drink. Good! I am really thirsty. You know it really is hot outside!
I have lemonade, iced tea, and mango juice. Mango juice would be perfect. Thank you!
Hi Ron, please come in! Good to see you, Malia. I love your house!
We are very lucky to be living in this house. Have you lived here a long time?
This was my parents' house, so I grew up here. It seems to be perfect for you.
Come on in and see the kitchen, and I'll get us both something to drink. Great! It's such a hot day today, isn't it?
Would you like lemonade, iced tea, or mango juice? I would love a nice glass of lemonade.
Come right on in, Ron, and welcome to our home! It's so nice to see you, Malia. What a wonderful home!
We really like living in this neighborhood. How long have you had this house?
We just moved here last year. It's a beautiful home. You've done a great job decorating it.
I've got some drinks for us in the kitchen.  That would be wonderful. It was really hot driving over here.
I can offer you lemonade, iced tea, or mango juice. Iced tea sounds really good right now!
Excuse me, could you help me pick out a lotion? Sure, what is the problem?
I got poison oak while hiking, and I need something to help me with the itching. I can suggest a product called Technu that comes in a lotion or cream.
Which do you prefer? Hikers tell me that the cream is best because it stays on longer.
Is there anything else I can do to help with the itching? You can take an antihistamine.
Thank you so much for all of the information. You are welcome. Please feel free to ask me a question any time you need help.
I need help picking out a lotion. It would be my pleasure to help you. What do you need help with?
I picked up some poison oak while hiking, and I can't stop itching. We have Technu, and it is available in lotion or cream.
Do you find that one works better than the other? I have heard that the cream is longer lasting.
Is there anything I can take that will help with the itching? If you take an antihistamine, that would help a lot.
Thank you for helping me figure out what to do with my poison oak. It was a pleasure. Come back anytime.
Can you help me find a lotion for a problem I am having? That's what I am here for. What questions can I answer for you?
I have poison oak, and I need help with the rash that won't stop itching. The best product is Technu, and you can buy either the lotion or cream.
Which one is best? The cream form is very popular.
Can I do anything else to help with the itching? You could also take an antihistamine to help the rash go away quicker.
I appreciate you helping me find a solution to the itching. Anytime you have a question, please feel free to ask.
Your office called and left a message that several offers had come in on our home. Yes, we received three offers in one day for your home!
Were the offers for a good price? One offer was for the full asking price, one slightly below, and one above.
Well, I am going to accept the highest bid, of course! Actually there are a few things to consider other than who is offering the most money.
What other factors do I need to consider? We need to consider the likelihood of the buyers actually being able to purchase the house.
How do we check on the buyer's ability to purchase our home? We will check to see if these buyers are pre-qualified for the loan amount that they need. This information will help you make a good decision.
When we get all of that information, then I will make my decision. When you make that decision, I will present it to the buyers.
I received your e-mail about the many purchase offers for my house. It has been quite a busy day regarding your home. We just received three offers!
Did the potential buyers offer a good price? There were offers above and below your asking price, as well as one exactly for the asking price.
The highest bid is always the best bid! We need to look at the big picture in deciding which bid to accept.
What things would you like me to look at? Just because a buyer offers the money doesn't mean that they actually have the credit to purchase the home.
How do I get the information about a buyer's ability to afford to buy a home? We will check to see if any of these buyers have a large down payment. A large amount of available cash would be a good sign.
I will wait for that information and give you my answer. Please let me know when you have made your decision, and I will contact the buyers.
My friend said that you had called regarding multiple offers for my home. The Open House was quite a success. Last night we received three offers on your home!
I am anxious to hear how good an offer we received! Offers above and below the asking price came in. One was right on the money.
Let's go with the highest bid! We need to look at a number of factors in deciding which bid to go with.
What matters besides getting the money for the house? We need to make sure that these potential buyers all actually qualify to even purchase a home.
I don't even know where to begin checking on a buyer's credit information. We can check to see if these buyers have already sold their current home. This would make them more desirable. 
I think that gathering that information will be helpful to me. Please let me know if I can further assist you in making your decision.
Excuse me, Professor. I am going to miss next week's class. Is this something that you could schedule for another time?
No, I have to do this it's important! Have you arranged for someone to take notes for you?
I've made arrangements with a friend to help me. You know that I only allow one absence per semester, don't you?
Yes, I know. Write down your name and the date on a piece of paper and give it to me.
OK, I can do that. Well, have a good day off from class.
Professor, I will not be here for our next class meeting. Is this absolutely necessary?
I tried to work something out, but I really do have to miss one class. Will you be able to make up the work you missed?
I'm going to be doing a lot of extra reading. Remember that I will only let you miss one class meeting per semester.
Yes, I remember. Could you e-mail me this week as a reminder?
Sure, no problem. Make good use of that day off you'll only have one this semester!
I have to miss school next week. Isn't there some way you could work your schedule out to be here?
Unfortunately, this is what I have to do. How are you going to catch up?
I've got it all covered. If you miss this class, you will have used up your quota for the semester.
Don't worry, this will be the last class I miss. Make sure to remind me right before you are absent.
I'll remember. Enjoy your day off and don't forget to study!

What are you going to eat with your sandwich? I think I'm going to eat a piece of fruit.
What kind do you like? I really like apples and grapes.
What kind of apples do you like to eat? I love green apples.
I don't like green apples. Really? Why not?
Green apples are too sour for me. So, you like red apples better?

What are you going to have along with your sandwich? I may have a piece of fruit.
What's your favorite kind of fruit? I really only eat apples and grapes.
What is your favorite kind of apples? Green apples are the best!

Red apples are great. They're not as good as green apples.
Are you going to eat anything with your sandwich? I may get some fruit.
Really, what kind of fruit do you like? I tend to only eat grapes and apples.
What kind of apples do you prefer? I've always liked green apples.
I don't really like green apples that much. Why do you say that?
I think they are too sour. You'd rather eat a red apple?
Don't you like red apples? They're okay, I guess.
Let's pull over and look at that house over there. Yes, that looks great! Is it on our Open House list?
Yes, it is on our list. Well, it looks great from the curb. Let's go on inside.
Let's sign the registry. The realtor looks kind of busy right now. OK, let's go check out the kitchen next.
look, they have some refreshments in here. Make sure that you pick up a flyer with the information about the home.
Does it say how much they are asking for this house? Yes, it seems to have been discounted from two hundred and thirty-five thousand to two hundred and twenty-five thousand.
I see an Open House sign over there, and I think we should go check it out. I think that looks like a very nice house. Is it on our Internet listing for Open Houses?
Yes, I see it listed on the printout we got off of the Internet. I love the beautiful lawn. What a great front entryway!
We need to make sure to put our names in the registry so the realtor knows we were here. That works for me. We can check out the kitchen next.
On such a hot day, it is thoughtful to have water out for potential buyers. Check out the flyer with all of the home's information on it.
What is the price of this house in the flyer? They have changed the asking price since it first went on the market. It is now two hundred and twenty-five thousand.
I want to take a look at that home with the Open House flags out front. What a wonderful neighborhood! Can you find that house on our Open House list?
Yes, that is one of the houses that we have on our list. They always make the front yards look so great for Open Houses. Let's see what the inside looks like.
I am going to go sign my name in the registry to let the listing agent know that we were here. Signing the registry is a good idea. I think I want to see the kitchen next.
I really appreciate that the listing agent provided water on such a hot day. I need to pick up a flyer with the information about the house on it.
Is the current asking price listed on the flyer? The asking price has recently gone down to two hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars.
I have a problem. What's the problem?
A pipe burst in my ceiling. Why do you think that?
There is water dripping from my ceiling. Is it causing a flood in your apartment?
No, but my carpet is getting wet. How long has this water been dripping?
It only started leaking today. I'll have someone come down to fix it right away.
That's great. I apologize for the inconvenience.
I'm calling about a problem with my apartment. Tell me what the problem is.
There must be a leaking pipe in my ceiling. Are you sure?
There is water leaking from my ceiling. Is the water flooding your apartment?
It's not flooding, but my carpet is beginning to smell. Has it been leaking long?
I believe it began leaking today. Someone will be right up to fix it.
I'd appreciate that. Let me also apologize about the problem.
I have a problem that needs fixing immediately. What is it?
I think that a pipe broke in my ceiling. How do you know?
The ceiling is wet and water is dripping onto my carpet. Your apartment isn't flooded, is it?
Not yet, but my carpet is wet. When did this all start?
It just started today. I will send a plumber up to fix it right now.
That would be fabulous. I'm sorry about the problem.
What should I do to get ready for the Open House? Your house needs to be as clean and uncluttered as possible.
Can we stay in the house while it is being shown? No one is to be in the house during the Open House except for the realtor and the potential buyers who are looking at the house.
Can we leave our dog in the backyard during the Open House? Absolutely no pets are to remain in the house during Open House. Take them with you or board them, please.
I have a lot of expensive jewelry and am afraid to leave it in the house.  We will do our best to watch over your things, but expensive jewelry and guns need to go with you.
How will we know when to come home? The Open House will last from eleven o'clock until four o'clock.
Is there anything special I should do to get ready for our Open House this weekend? Just make sure that your house is perfectly clean and that everything is put away.
My husband wants to watch the game, and we were wondering if he could stay in his den during Open House. Everyone in the household must leave the premises before potential buyers arrive.
Can the cat stay on the bed during Open House? No pets are allowed at the Open House! Maybe your neighbor would let your pets stay over there for a few hours.
Where can I hide my expensive jewelry? If you have a safe, put your jewelry in there. Otherwise, please take your valuables with you.
Will you let us know when everyone has left? Usually the Open Houses last until four o'clock. If this one ends earlier, I will call you on your cell phone.
What suggestions do you have for preparing for the Open House on Saturday? The two most important things are that your home is clean and clutter free.
My mother is old and wants to stay in her room during the Open House. Absolutely no occupants of the house are to be present during an Open House.
We have several pet snakes and would like them to stay in the garage during Open House. You wouldn't want someone to hate your house because they can't stand animals, would you? Your pets need to disappear for a bit!
Will someone be watching to make sure my expensive jewelry doesn't get ripped off? We have two realtors to keep an eye on things at all times, but please don't keep valuable jewelry or guns in your home when it is being shown.
What time will the Open House be over? You can come home at four o'clock if you like. If it is rainy and slow, I will call you if I decide to end it a little early.
Would you be able to pick me up at the airport next Sunday? Sure, I would be happy to help you. What time are you arriving?
I will be arriving at 3:00 in the afternoon. By the time you pick up your luggage, it will be around 3:30. What if I meet you outside at the curb?
That would be a good time to meet, but what if I am running late? I can track your plane online. I can just put in the flight number and I can see if you are on time.
Can you make sure that you have your cell phone with you so I can call you? Yes, that would be good idea.
If something happens and you can't make it, just let me know and I'll book a Super Shuttle. Don't worry. I'll be able to pick you up.
I am flying in next Sunday and was wondering if you might be able to pick me up at the airport. I can pick you up. What time does your flight arrive?
My flight arrives at 3:00 in the afternoon. I think if I am at the curb at 3:30, that would allow you time to pick up your luggage. How does that sound?
I think that would work out well, but what if the plane is late? I can call the airline, and they will tell me if the flight is delayed.
I am going to carry my cell phone so I can call you. Yes, that would help us find each other at the airport.
If you find that you have to make other plans, I can always book a Super Shuttle to pick me up. You don't have to take a Super Shuttle. I'll be there.
Could you help me out and pick me up at the airport next Sunday? It would be no problem to pick you up. When is your flight arriving?
I am coming in around 3:00 in the afternoon. I think that by the time we factor in half an hour to clear Customs, that maybe I should meet you at the curb at 3:30.
I will meet you at the curb, but how will you know if the plane is delayed? Don't worry. I can track your flight on my iPhone browser.
I want to be able to call you on my cell phone in a pinch. I'll make sure to keep my cell phone with me and turned on.
If it doesn't work out, just let me know and I can take a Super Shuttle. You won't need to take a Super Shuttle. Just stay in touch and look for me!

I need help figuring out how to use this phone. Sure. First you pick up the receiver and hit one of the first 3 buttons. Do you hear a tone?
Yes, I hear the tone. OK. Now you dial 9 on the keypad. Do you hear the tone change?
Yes, it changed. Well, when you hear it change, that means you have an outside line. Where are you trying to call?
I am trying to call home. OK. Well, to dial to the outside you just now dial the number. For a call inside the company just hit the extension number. Do you know the extensions?
Yes, I have a list of extensions. Well, if you ever need help with an extension, you can dial O.
Can you show me how to use this phone? Yes, I can help you with that. Pick up the receiver and hit one of the buttons. Do you hear a tone?

I'm not sure. OK. Well, after you get the line to change you have an outside line. Who are you trying to call?
I am trying to call a client. To call a number on the outside you now just dial the number. For inside calls, punch in the extension number. Has someone given you an extension list?
No, I don't know anyone's extension. All of the extensions are listed on the wall chart over there if you ever need help.
I want to make a phone call. Can you show me how? Of course, pick up the receiver, hit a button and listen for a tone. Are you hearing it?
Yes, now what do I do? Well, after you dial 9 on the keypad, you should hear the tone change.
No, nothing changed. When you dial 9 and hear the tone change it means you have an outside line. Who are you trying to call?
I am trying to call my boss. For an outside call you now just dial the number. For a company number you need to know the extension. Do you have a list of extensions?
I know a few extensions but I don't know all of them. You can always look an extension up on the company website.
Hey, did you hear about Jessica's party this weekend? Yeah, but I'm still waiting for my invitation.
Oh really? She gave me mine earlier today. Well, she'll probably just give me my invitation later on today.
Yeah, so are you planning on going? I think so. It sounds like it's going to be a lot of fun.
It really does, I can't wait. What time does the party start?
It starts at 8 o'clock. Oh, well, how many people has she given invites to so far?

Have you heard about Jessica's party on Saturday? I've heard about it, but I'm still waiting for my invitation.
Really? I got mine from her this morning. I'm guessing that she's going to give me my invite today or tomorrow.
You're probably right, do you intend on going to the party? I want to. I heard it's going to be really fun.
I know, it does sound pretty awesome. Well, when does the party start?
It's supposed to start at about eight. How many invitations has she given out?
I really don't know, but I don't think she gave out that many yet. I really want to go, so I hope that she gives me my invite soon.
Has anyone told you about Jessica's party coming up? I was told about it already. I'm just waiting for my invitation.
Is that right? I already got my invitation from her earlier. I believe that she will give me the invitation today.
Are you even going to go? Yeah, it sounds like it's going to be the best party of the year.
Exactly, it seems like it's going to be loads of fun. When exactly does the party start?
The invitation says it starts at 8:00 p.m. Has she given out a lot of invitations yet?
I have no idea, she hasn't given out many though. I'm planning on going, but I really need her to give me my invitation.
Hello, may I speak to Alice please? This is she. How's it going?
I've been trying to call you all day. Sorry about that. I was cleaning up.
It's okay. So what were you calling me about?
Oh, I just wanted to see if you wanted to hang out tomorrow. Sure, what did you want to do?
Maybe we can go see a movie or something. That sounds like fun. Let's do it.
I'll see you tomorrow then. See you then. Goodbye.
Hi, how are you. Is Alice there? Speaking. What's up?
Why haven't you answered the phone? My bad, I had chores to do.
That's all right. What was the reason for your call?
I want to do something tomorrow with you. Sounds good. What did you have in mind?
I was thinking about seeing a movie. Okay, let's go see a movie.
Until then. Talk to you later.
Is Alice available? You're talking to her.
I've called you a hundred times today. I was busy doing something. I apologize.
No problem. Did you need something?
Do you want to do something tomorrow? Is there somewhere special you wanted to go?
How about a movie? A movie sounds good.
Call me tomorrow then. I will see you tomorrow.
Hey, Robert, what are you doing this weekend? I didn't have any big plans.
We are putting together a birthday party for Mary. That sounds like fun. Where will it be?
We thought it would be fun to have a pool party at Jay's house. Oh good! Can I bring anything?
We will be providing hot dogs, hamburgers, and cake, but people can bring side dishes. I am assuming that the dress is casual.
Dress casually and bring your bathing suit! Wonderful. Just e-mail me the time and date and I'll be there.
Robert, do you have plans for the weekend? I have nothing definite planned.
Saturday is Mary's birthday, and we are throwing her a party. Sure, I could come to her party. Where are you going to have it?
It's going to be a pool party at Jay's apartment building.  That sounds like fun. Is it a potluck?
We would like for people to help us by bringing side dishes and drinks. The dress will be casual then?
Make sure to bring your bathing suit, and dress casually. Sounds great. Just drop me an e-mail with the time you've picked.
Robert, are you going to be in town this weekend? I don't have anything scheduled yet.
We were wondering if you would like to come to Mary's birthday party on Saturday. I would enjoy coming to Mary's party. Will it be at your house?
The party will be at Jay's house out by the pool. Will everyone be pitching in with some food?
It would be great if you could bring a side dish, but the rest of the food will be provided. What should we wear?
This is a pool party, so make sure to bring your bathing suit. Sounds like we'll have a great time. When you've figured out the details, drop me an e-mail.
I'm planning on going to the market soon. What are you buying?
I don't know what we need. I can check for you, if you'd like.
I'll make a list. First, we need eggs, milk, and bread.
Do we need any meat? How about some chicken, ground beef, and some steak.
What else do we need? Get some snack foods.
Is there anything else that we need? No, but if you can think of anything else, just get it.
I need to go to the market. Do you know what to get?
I'm not sure what to get. I'll go check for you.
Tell me what we need and I'll write a list. We need the basics. Like, eggs, milk, and bread.
What kind of meat do we need? You should buy some steak, some chicken, and ground beef.
Do we need anything else? Why don't you get some snacks?
Can you think of anything else? Get whatever else that you need.
I'm going to the market in a little bit. What are you going to get?
Do you know what we need to get? Would you like me to check?
Alright, and I'll write everything down. You need to buy bread, eggs, and milk.
Should I get some meat? Yes. Get some chicken, ground beef, and steak.
What else? We can also use some snacks.
You can't think of anything else? You can get whatever else you want.
I really feel like eating a salad. What kind are you going to make?
I'm really not sure. I really like Caesar salads.
Caesar salads are pretty good. What kind of salad do you want to make?
I want a salad with some chicken. I love chicken salads.
I like my salads to have croutons, almonds, and shredded cheese. That sounds really tasty.
You should make a salad like that. I think that I will.
I feel like I'm craving a salad. What kind do you want?
I have no idea. Caesar salads are good.
I like those too. What kind do you plan on making?
I'd really like a salad with chicken. Chicken salads are really good.
I always make my salads with shredded cheese, croutons, and almonds. That sounds like a great salad.
Why don't you put it in your salad? That sounds like a plan to me.
I really want to make a salad. Do you know what kind of salad that you want?
I'm not sure what kind that I want. I usually make a Caesar salad.
Those taste really good. Which kind of salad are you going to make?
I want a chicken salad. I enjoy chicken salads.
I like salads with croutons, almonds, and shredded cheese. I really like how that sounds.
Why don't you make a salad like that? I'm going to do that then.
I need to get a taxi. We have a variety of transportation services. Would you prefer a private vehicle to a taxi?
No, that won't be necessary. I just need a taxi. Perhaps you'd prefer a limousine. That's such a stylish way to travel.
Just a taxi, please. And what is your destination?
I'm going to Rockefeller Center. I see. What time do you want to depart from the hotel?
I want to leave as soon as possible. Okay, a taxi will arrive in seconds, sir.
Thank you, I'm coming down now. It won't be but a few seconds, sir.
I need a taxi, please. We have various transportation services. Would you prefer a private vehicle?
No, thanks. A taxi is just fine. May I suggest a limo? It's nice to pamper yourself once in a while.
I don't want anything except a taxi, thank you. I understand. And where will you be going?
Rockefeller Center. And what time would you like to be picked up?
The sooner the better. A taxi will be here shortly, sir.
Great! And remember, a taxi, not a limo. A taxi it is, sir.
Can you get me a taxi? We offer various types of transportation. Perhaps you'd like to upgrade to a private vehicle?
Thanks, but no thanks. A taxi will do just fine. In that case, how about a limo? Then you can travel in style.
No, I hate limousines. They're gas guzzlers. Got it, sir. Where would you like the taxi to take you?
My destination is Rockefeller Center. What time do you want to leave the hotel?
As soon as possible. I'll call the taxi immediately, sir.
I'm coming downstairs now. A brand new taxi is pulling up now, sir.
I'm going to need a taxi. You don't have to restrict yourself to a taxi. We can offer you a private vehicle.
A private vehicle, huh? No, a taxi is okay. Some people find a limo to be much more comfortable than a taxi.
No, I wouldn't be caught dead in a limo. No upgrade of any kind. And where might you be going?
I'm headed to Rockefeller Center. When shall I tell the taxi to be here?
Right now. The taxi will be here immediately, sir.
Good, I'm leaving my room in about one minute. You won't have to wait a second, sir.
I need a taxi. We could easily provide you with a private vehicle, if you'd prefer.
No, the taxi will do. Perhaps you'd like to take a beautiful limousine.
No, thank you. Taxis and I get along just fine. No private vehicle, no limo. Got it. Where are you going?
I'm seeing a show at Rockefeller Center. What time should the taxi be here to pick you up?
I'm ready to go right now. I'll have a taxi for you momentarily, sir.
Great! As soon as I brush my teeth, I'll be downstairs. You'll enjoy our new, clean taxis, sir.
Could you please reserve a taxi for me? Do you think a private vehicle might be more to your liking?
A private vehicle? No, thanks, I won't need one. Even better than a private vehicle is a limo. How does that sound?
T A X I, please. A taxi it is. Where will you be headed? 
Rockefeller Center. Can you get the taxi here immediately, please? A taxi will be here in just a minute, sir.
Good. I'll get my coat and come downstairs. The taxi will be ready when you are, sir.
Hi. I wanted to talk to you about the letter we received about fumigating the building. Yes, I would be happy to help you with that. What do you need to know?
Do we have to leave our apartment on the day they do it? You will have to vacate your apartment for a 36-hour period.
Will you be paying for our hotel room? Yes, I will be paying for all the rooms.
What if I want to stay at a different hotel? I received a group rate at this hotel, but I will pay the equivalent price if you bring me a receipt.
What if I stay with friends? If you do not stay in a hotel, I will give you fifty dollars for the inconvenience.
Is there anything else we have to do? Yes, your letter also mentions what food you need to remove.
Good morning. I had some questions about the fumigation letter we received. I am here to answer your questions. What do you need clarification on?
Will I have to find somewhere else to go on that day? You cannot stay in your apartment for 36 hours while it is being fumigated.
Are you going to pay us for the hotel room you mentioned in your letter? The rooms have already been reserved and paid for.
If I don't like that hotel, can I stay somewhere else? I got a great deal at this hotel, but you can choose a room of equal or less value at another hotel.
I have my pets to think of and I'd rather stay with my parents. You will be given fifty dollars for the night.
What else do we need to think about? The letter also tells you about storing and removing your food.
Hello. Could you help me understand a few things about the fumigation letter? It would be my pleasure to help you. What is your question?
Can I still stay in my apartment while they are doing this? You and your pets will have to leave your apartment for 36 hours.
Are you putting us up in the hotel you mentioned, or do we have to pay for it? We will be paying for the rooms.
Do I have a choice as to what hotel I stay in? If you want to switch hotels, just bring me the receipt and I will reimburse you for the same amount of money that I would have spent on you.
I think I might just go stay with my boyfriend. If you have another place to stay, you will get fifty dollars for the night.
What other safety precautions do we need to take? The letter you received includes a checklist that tells you how to store your food.
Can you go to the store for me? Sure, I can go to the store for you. What do you need?
Just a couple things, here's a list. Is there anything else that you want me to pick up?
No, I think that's all that I need. Is there any other place you would like me to go to for you?
If you can, could you pick up my prescription for me? Sure, no problem. Is your prescription ready?
I think so. It should be. Okay, I'll pick it up for you.
Thank you so much. You're welcome.
Can you pick up some things from the store for me? Of course, what do you need? 
I need a few things, I'll give you the list. Is there something else you need that you can think of?
Everything I need is on the list. Do you want me to make any other stops while I'm out?
Since you asked, would you pick up my medicine from the pharmacy? Is it ready to be picked up?
I believe so. No problem. I'll do that for you.
I really appreciate you doing this for me. It's no problem at all.
I would appreciate it if you could go to the store for me. No problem. What do you want me to get?
Here's a list with a few things that I need you to get. Did you forget to put anything on the list?
I don't think I forgot anything. Would you like me to go anywhere else for you?
If you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you would pick up my prescription. Has your prescription been filled yet?
Someone at the pharmacy called and told me it was ready. Sure, I'll go get it for you.
Thank you. Anything for you.
How are you doing today? Great. Thank you.
What can I do for you? I need to withdraw some money.

All right, here is your $300. Thanks a lot.
Is there anything else that I can do for you today? No. That's everything. Thank you.
What a wonderful dinner! Thank you. I am glad that you are enjoying it.
Where did you get your fantastic recipes? I grew up cooking. My mother shared her recipes with me.
I especially like the wonderful chicken dish. That is a special coconut ginger chicken with rice dish.
Is that shrimp in the soup? Yes, do you like it? I added a little extra lemon grass and some sea vegetables.
I am happy that the wine I brought for you works well with this meal. Yes, thank you for bringing the wine. It really complements the meal.
This is a great meal! Thank you. I am glad that everything turned out so well.
Who taught you how to cook this well? I took a cooking class at the Culinary Institute.
Wow, what is in this chicken dish? Isn't that great? That is coconut ginger chicken with rice.
Is the soup a shrimp soup? Yes, there is shrimp in there along with sea vegetables and lemon grass.
I think I got lucky in choosing a wine that blends with this meal. I appreciate you bringing the wine. It goes well with the chicken.
I really love this meal. Thanks. I was hoping that you would all enjoy this meal.
Where did you learn to cook these amazing dishes? I got a really wonderful cookbook for my birthday and decided to try out a few of the recipes.
The chicken is out of this world! I love that dish as well. It is coconut chicken with rice.
I was wondering if there was shrimp in the soup. Yes, that soup has a shrimp base. I also added sea vegetables and lemon grass.
It worked out well that the wine that I brought to share seems to blend well with this meal. I love this wine! It goes very well with the chicken.
This is Janet Smith in apartment 23. Can I speak to the apartment manager? Hi. How can I help you today?
Well, my window facing the empty lot is broken. Oh, that's not good. What happened?
I dont know. I wasn't home when it happened. Do you have any clue who might have done this?
I have a feeling that it might have been the neighborhood kids. Why, what leads you to that suspicion?
Well, next to the broken glass was a baseball. Well, a baseball is certainly solid evidence.
I saw them playing just before I left my apartment. Well, did you recognize any of them?
No, I just took a quick look. Well, it'll take a couple of days to repair it.
A friend of mine is in the business. How about if I call him? That's okay by me. First, let me come see the damage.
Come on over. So does my friend charge you or me? Since you didn't break it, you don't have to pay for it.
That's a relief. I thought I was going to get stuck with the bill. If I knew which kid did it, I would bill his parents.
I'm Janet Smith in apartment 23. Is this the apartment manager? Hello. What can I do for you today?
My living room window is broken. Are you serious? Do you know what happened?
I am not really sure, because I was out when it occurred. Do you have any idea who might have been behind this?
Something tells me it might be some of the kids in the complex. What led you to think it might be the kids in this building?
I found a baseball near the broken glass. Well, you can't ignore a baseball in your living room, can you?
I saw them in the lot just before I went out. Do you know any of them?
No, I didn't pay any attention to who they were. I'll call the window repairman, but it'll probably take a couple of days.
I could get fast service if I call a friend of mine. I don't have a problem with that. Let me look at the damage first.
Okay, I'm waiting for you. But who does my friend give the bill to? Since the kids broke it, your friend can bill me.
Whew! I was worried that I would have to pay for it. Believe me, if I find out which kid broke the window, I'll bill his parents.
This is Janet Smith in apartment 23. May I speak to the apartment manager? Speaking. What can I do for you?
Something happened to my window. It's broken. That doesn't sound good. Do you know how it happened?
I don't know the exact details. Do you have an idea who might be responsible for the window?
I'm almost sure it is the local kids in the apartments. How did you come to that conclusion?
There was a baseball in my living room along with the broken glass. Well, at least there's no mystery about how it happened.
I saw a group of them playing in the lot just before I went out to my car. Can you tell me which ones you recognized?
I just looked at them for a second. I'll call a repairman, but it might take two days.
How about if I call a friend of mine who is a repairman? That's no problem. I'll come by right now to look at the damage.
Okay. Come on over. But tell me, who pays for this? You can pay for it, and I can reimburse you. Or he can bill me directly.
I'm glad to hear that. I didn't want to get stuck with the bill. I will bill the kid's parents if I ever find out which kid did it.
Hello, I'm John Smith in unit 23. Am I speaking to the apartment manager? This is he. How may I help you?
My window that faces the empty lot is broken. I'm sorry to hear that. Why is it broken?
I can't tell you exactly how it happened. Well, tell me what you think might have happened.
I've got a pretty good idea that it's the kids who live here. Why do you think that?
Next to the broken glass in my living room was a baseball. Well, you don't need Sherlock Holmes to figure this one out, do you?
Just before I went shopping, I saw them in the lot. Can you give me a name or two, or a description?
I have absolutely no idea. I'll call a repairman for you, but it'll probably take one or two days.
I could probably get it fixed today, because a friend of mine is a repairman. That's okay. But let me see the damage first. I'm coming over.
The glass is all cleaned up, so come on over. But do I pay for this? No. I will pay your friend, or I will reimburse you if you pay him.
That's good news. I was worried you were going to make me pay for this. You're not at fault. But the kid who did it is.
This is John Smith in unit 23. Is this the apartment manager? Hi. What do you need today?
I've got a broken living room window. I'm sorry about that. How did it get broken?
I've got a good idea, but I'm not exactly sure. Well, why don't you give me a few details?
I would bet a dollar to a dime that it's one of the local kids. Do you have any support for that charge?
A baseball was on my living room carpet. I don't own a baseball. Well, it sounds like someone hit a home run.
I saw them playing ball in the lot just before I went to the market. Do you know for sure who they were?
All I did was glance at them before I left. If you like, I'll call a repairman, but it might take a few days.
How about if I call my friend? He's a repairman and could probably fix it today. Sure. Let me come over to see the damage right now, though.
Sure, come on over, but tell me, do I have to pay for this? You're not responsible, so you don't pay. Tell him to bill me.
Well, lucky me. I was afraid that I was going to get stuck for the bill. Maybe I'll install a camera on that end of the building to catch these kids.
What can I do for you today? I have an issue.
What is your problem? There were charges on my debit card that I never made.
Do you have a statement for your debit card? I do.
Which charges are you talking about? It's the last four charges.
We're going to have to do an investigation. Is that going to take long?
I'm not sure, but in the meantime we will freeze these charges. That's wonderful. Thank you.
How may I help you? I'm having a problem.
What problem are you having? There have been charges made on my debit card that I didn't make.
Do you have the statement for your card? Here it is.
What are the charges you're referring to? The last four charges on the page.
I'm afraid we're going to have to investigate these charges. How long will an investigation take?
I honestly don't know, but we will freeze payment on these charges. That sounds absolutely fantastic.
May I help you? I have a problem.
What's the problem? Someone else is making charges on my debit card.
I need to see a statement for your debit card. I have it right here.
Can you show me which charges you're referring to? The last four charges.
We will need to do an investigation on this. How long will that take?
We'll have to freeze payment on those charges until the investigation is finished. I really appreciate your help.
Can you tell me where the produce is? It's in aisle A.
Do you know what produce is on sale? I don't know. Check the flyer or check with the produce person.
Where is the produce? It's on the south wall of the store, in aisle A.
Is there any produce on sale? I don't know. The produce person can tell you, though.
Where can I find the produce? Aisle A is where you'll find all the produce.
What sales do they have today? I'm sure something is on sale. Please check with the produce person.
Which aisle has the produce? Aisle A is where you'll find all the produce.
Are cherries on sale today? I don't know, but I'm sure the produce person can tell you.
I'm looking for the produce section, please. All of the produce is in aisle A.
Are bananas on sale today? Here you go. Look in this flyer, or check with the produce person.
Excuse me, Professor. I think there might be an error in my test score. Sure. Do you think that the total is wrong or that you got something marked wrong that should have been marked right?
I think that the percentage is incorrect. Let's just go over all of it to double-check.
Sure, let's do it. Here is the answer sheet. Do you see a place where I marked something wrong that should have been right?
I don't see any mistakes. OK, now that we've gotten those straightened out, let's total the score.
Yes, let's total it. Well, if I total that like this and divide by this number, I get this total. Do you agree?
Yes, you're right. Well then, we are all straight. Have a good day and thanks for bringing that to my attention.
I was looking at my test score and think that it should be higher. Is the math wrong or the way the answer was marked?
I think an answer got marked wrong that should have been marked right. These things can happen let's double-check the answers first to be sure, all right?
That would be great! Look at the answer sheet and compare it to your answers. Do you see any place where I made a mistake in grading?
This one right here should be right. Yeah, I see the same thing now we can do the math and check that, right?
Yeah, let's do the math. I count all of the correct answers, total them, and divide by the total. Does this look right to you?
Looks pretty good. Thank you for caring enough to check on your scores keep studying!
Could we go over some things, because I think my test score is wrong. What do you think is wrong, the math or the way your answer was scored?
Both. I am willing to take a second look because teachers make mistakes, too. Will that work for you?
Yeah, I'm ready. Check your answers against the ones on the answer sheet and let me know where you see the mistake.
These look strange. Yes, I agree let's move on to the calculating of the score. Would that be OK?
OK, let's do the calculation. We add all of these up and divide by this and that gives us this percentage.
I see. Anytime you have a question, please feel free to ask!
So how much did the buyers bid on our house? Your asking price was three hundred thousand dollars. The potential buyers offered two hundred ninety thousand dollars.
That's a great offer! Yes, it is a good offer. Before you accept, we should look at some details.
What else do we need to look at? They want you to pay all closing costs. Of course, they are making the sale contingent on an inspection showing no major defects in the house.
I think that that sounds fair. You could put in a counteroffer, but I know that these buyers also have their eye on another house down the street.
I definitely want to accept their offer. Excellent decision! I will notify them immediately.
I am so anxious to hear what the bid was on our house! Remember that we set the asking price at three hundred thousand dollars. The first offer is two hundred ninety thousand dollars.
That's way better than I expected so early in the game! The offer is definitely a good one, but let's make sure we look at the whole picture.
What are the other considerations? They want you to pay for the inspection, but they want to pick out the inspector. If the house is defective, they will want out of the deal.
I don't have a problem with that. You could make them a counteroffer, but I know that you need a timely sale.
Please notify the buyers that I have accepted their offer. I think that you are making the right choice. I will phone the buyers right away!
What did the buyers offer us on our house? With the original asking price at three hundred thousand dollars, the buyers are willing to pay two hundred ninety thousand dollars.
I am really pleased with that offer. I agree that the offer is in the ballpark. We need to consider everything before you accept.
Besides the selling price, what else is there to consider? They want you to pay to have the cracks in the back wall fixed and a couple of the roof tiles replaced.
All of that is acceptable to me. A counteroffer by you is always a possibility, but their price is very close to your asking price. You could risk losing the sale.
I wish to officially accept their offer. This is a win-win situation for both you and the buyer. I am sure that you will both be happy with your decision.
I want to go try on these clothes. What did you find?
I found some jeans, and a new blouse. Go and try it on.
What do you think? I love that shirt on you.
What about the jeans? They don't really fit you right.
I don't think so either. That blouse is absolutely wonderful on you.
I'll just buy the shirt. That would be a good idea.
I need to try these clothes on. What are you going to try on?
I just found some jeans and a top. Try it on.
How do I look in this? That shirt looks great.
How do these jeans look? They don't look nice on you.
I don't like them either. I just like that shirt.
I'm just going to buy the shirt. Good, because those pants are ugly.
I'm going to go try these on in the dressing room. What clothes did you find?
I'm just trying on a pair of jeans and a shirt. Go try them on.
Alright, how do I look? You look great in that shirt.
What do you think of these jeans? I don't like how those look.
I really don't think they look good. That shirt looks great though.
I guess I'm just going to buy the shirt. That would be wise.
How are you doing today? Great. Thanks.
What can I help you with? I would like to open a bank account.
What kind would you like to open? I need a checking account.

I will set your accounts up right now. Would you please put $150 in both accounts?
How are things with you? I'm fine. Thank you.
May I help you with something? I want to open a bank account.
Do you know what kind of account you want to open? I want to open a checking account.
You should also open a savings account. That would be great.
To open these accounts, you will need to make a deposit of at least $50. I would actually like to deposit $300 today.
Let me do that for you now. Please put $150 in each account for me.
I hear the young couple that came by the other day made an offer on our house. Yes, the potential buyers made an offer this morning.
Is the offer a good offer? The offer is pretty good. You asked three hundred thousand and they offered two hundred eighty thousand.
I would be willing to take two hundred ninety thousand, but no lower. You could make a counteroffer of two hundred ninety thousand dollars. Would you like to do that?
Yes, I would like to make the counteroffer. I will make the counteroffer immediately by phone.
What if they don't accept the counteroffer? They can make a counteroffer themselves or state that their first offer stands.
I got a message on my machine that you received an offer on my house. Yes, the offer came in late last night. It was too late to call you.
Is the offer as high as we were hoping for? They offered two hundred eighty thousand dollars, and you were asking three hundred thousand dollars. They are definitely in the ballpark.
I was prepared to go a little lower, but more like two hundred ninety thousand dollars. Would you like to make a counteroffer of two hundred ninety thousand dollars?
I definitely would like to make a counteroffer. I will FAX them the counteroffer right away.
What if my counteroffer gets turned down? They have an option of making a counteroffer, or they can just reject your counteroffer.
Your office called and said that an offer came in on our house. Yes, the offer came in less than an hour ago.
How good of an offer did we receive? Their bid was two hundred eighty thousand dollars, and you said that you wanted three hundred thousand dollars. Their bid is a reasonable start.
We built a little leeway into the asking price, but I don't want to accept less than two hundred ninety thousand dollars. Sellers frequently make a counteroffer. Would you like to counteroffer two hundred ninety thousand dollars?
I think that a counteroffer would be wise at this point. I will contact their agent right away with your counteroffer.
What should we do if they don't like the counteroffer? If the seller doesn't want to accept your counteroffer, they can reject it or come up with a counteroffer of their own.
I heard that you finished my home inspection, and I was wondering how it went. First of all, we need to understand what I was looking for. Do you know what the purpose of an inspection is?
I am not sure what a home inspection is all about. I went there to check for problems with the home, so you aren't surprised when you move in.
Wouldn't the owners have told me about any problems? Sellers aren't always truthful, and there might also be problems that they aren't aware of.
Can I require the owners to fix the problems? You can make the sale of the house contingent on them fixing the problems.
What did you find out when you did the inspection of my new home? There were no major problems. One leaky pipe under the sink and two broken roof tiles was all that I found.
Can you tell me the results of my home inspection? Before I answer that, I want to make sure that you know what I was looking for. Are you clear on what I was looking for?
I never had a home inspection before. I inspect the home for problems that might not be all that apparent in a quick walk-through.
I asked the owners, and they said that everything was great with the house. The owners might not be aware of everything wrong with the house. Some things are hidden, but might still be a problem for you in the future.
I heard that the owners must fix all of the problems before the escrow closes. I inform you of the problems. If there are major problems, you can decline to buy the house or they may wish to fix any problems.
What kinds of things did you discover in my home inspection? I found some fairly major problems. A major support beam in the roof is broken, and the shower floor leaked and rotted out the second-floor joist.
I came in to see how my home inspection went. First of all, I need to share what the purpose of a home inspection is. Do you understand what I was doing there?
I had a home inspection before, but didn't really understand it. I help you spot potential problems with the home before you purchase it.
The owner said that the roof had leaked, but that he got it fixed last month. Sellers aren't really all that objective. They may have gotten used to a leaky faucet, but it is still broken.
Are the sellers responsible for fixing the problems with the house? The owners may wish to pay to have the problems fixed, or maybe the price of the house can be reduced.
Did you find a lot of things wrong during the home inspection? The house has a very outdated electrical system. Many of the switches and outlets do not work and are unsafe.
Doctor, can you give me some suggestions on how to stay healthy? Well, first of all, you need to make sure that you eat the right foods.
What are the best foods to eat? You should emphasize fresh fruits and vegetables, along with whole grains and protein.
What should I avoid? You need to avoid highly fatty and greasy foods. You should also avoid too much sugar and caffeine.
What else is important to stay healthy? You need to get plenty of exercise every day. If you smoke, you need to stop.
Is it OK to drink alcohol? Actually, studies have shown that people who have one-half a glass of alcohol per day do better than those who don't drink.
Doctor, what is the best way to stay healthy? Having a good diet is probably the most important thing.
It is very confusing to know what to eat. You need plenty of fruits and vegetables, small amounts of protein, and whole grains.
Are there certain things that I should avoid? You shouldn't consume too much sugar or caffeine. Also, watch your intake of fatty food.
After watching my diet, what else should I do? You need to stop smoking, and make sure that you get 30 minutes of exercise every day.
Can I have a glass of wine now and then? As long as you don't overdo it, a glass of wine a day should be OK.
Doctor, what are some things I can do to stay as healthy as I can be? You need to eat healthy foods and avoid unhealthy foods.
Sometimes I don't know what the best foods are. Fresh fruits and vegetables are important, along with protein and whole grains.
What things should I avoid? You don't want to eat food that is high in fat. You need to avoid caffeine and sugar.
Beyond diet, what else can I do to be healthy?  Getting 30 minutes of exercise a day is important. If you smoke, you need to stop.
How about having a beer on the weekend? Less than a serving of alcohol a day can actually be good for you. Do not overdo it!
The doctor sent me over here to have my blood drawn. Certainly, please have a seat and roll up your left sleeve.
What is this test for? Well, today your doctor wants us to check your white blood cell count.
What does that tell him? Well, if it is elevated, you might have an infection.
Will the blood test hurt? It is only a little pin stick. I am going to put a tourniquet on your arm to puff your veins up.
Ouch! There we go! I got the blood that I needed.
My doctor says that I need a blood test. I can help you with that. Just have a seat and roll up your left sleeve.
What are you taking my blood for? Your doctor has requested a check of your white blood count.
What information does that give him? If your white blood cell count is off, it could signal an infection somewhere in your body.
Is a blood test painful? I am putting a tourniquet on your arm to plump up the vein. It will only feel like a little pin prick.
My God, that hurts! That was it! Thank you for coming in today.
I came to this lab to have my blood drawn. You are in the right place. Roll up your left sleeve and have a seat.
What am I being tested for? Your doctor wants to know what your white blood cell count is.
What does my white blood cell count tell him? Usually if your white count is off, the doctor suspects an infection.
How much will it hurt? It is only a pin prick. I have to put this tourniquet on your arm to make the vein easier to find.
Is that my blood going into that tube? That blood that just filled the tube is all that I needed. Thanks for coming in!
Do you realize what time it is? I'm sorry, I lost track of time.
Do you honestly believe that that is a good excuse? Not at all--that is what really happened.
How many times do I have to ask you to call if you're going to be late? Yes, I know. I must've forgot.
That's beside the point, you still should have called. You're right. I'm sorry.
Next time you come in late without calling, you're gone. You're really going to kick me out?
Yes, maybe then you'll figure out how to follow the rules. Actually, if you kick me out, your rules won't matter anymore.
Do you have any idea what time it is? My bad. I didn't realize that it was so late.
Do you really think that that excuses your tardiness? Of course not. I really did lose track of time.
Didn't I tell you to call when you're running late? Yeah, you did. I just forgot to call.
It doesn't matter, you should have called and let me know. That's true. My bad for not calling.
If you do this again, don't even bother coming home. You're going to kick me out over this?
Exactly, maybe that'll teach you to respect my rules. Well, if I'm not living here anymore, then I won't have to listen to your rules.
Do you know how late it is? My fault. I didn't realize what time it was.
I hope you don't think that excuse lets you off the hook. Not really. I'm telling the truth.
Haven't I asked you to call if you're going to be home late? This is true, but it must've slipped my mind.
Regardless, all you had to do was give a call. I know. I should've called.
Come home late one more time, and you'll find your stuff outside. You want to throw me out over this?
That's right, maybe then you'll respect my rules. That's fine, because if I leave, then your rules won't matter.
How are you doing today? I'm fine.
What can I do for you? I would like to cancel a check.
Is there a problem? I wrote the check out for too much.
How much did you write it out for? I wrote it out for $150.
How much was it supposed to be? It was supposed to be for $100.
I'll cancel that check for you. I really appreciate your help.
How are you? I'm doing well.
How may I help you? Could you cancel a check for me?
What's the problem? I wrote the check out for way too much.
How much? I wrote the check out for $150.
What were you supposed to write it out for? I was supposed to write the check out for $100.
I'll just cancel it for you right now. That's great. You're a lifesaver.
How's it going? Great. Thank you.
What can I help you with? I need to cancel a check.
What's wrong with the check? I accidentally wrote the check for too much.
How much did you write the check for? The check was written for $150.
How much were you supposed to write it for? I needed to write it for $100.
I can cancel it for you right now. Thank you so much.
Could you help me? What do you need?
I can't seem to find my class. What building is it in?
It's in the C building. Oh, I know exactly where that is.
Do you think you can tell me where it is? Sure, what room number is it?
It's room number 261. I have a class around there right now.
Could you show me where it is? No problem, come on.
Excuse me, I need your assistance. Sure, what's up?
I have no idea where my class is. Tell me which building it's in.
My class is in the C building. I know where the C building is.
Do you mind telling me where it is? Of course, which room number is it?
Number 261. I actually have a class right around there.
Can you please show me? I can do that.
Do you mind helping me? What can I help you with?
I'm not sure how to find my next class. Do you know what building that it's in?
The C building, I think. Well, that's not far away.
Could you point me in that direction? Do you know what the room number is?
It's C261. My next class is around there.
Can you show it to me? Sure, let's go.
I was thinking of holding the company retreat in the mountains. I agree, I think that that would be perfect!
I was thinking it could take place sometime in January. That might be a little too cold for some people.
Yes, you are right. What about April? April has good weather that isn't too cold or too hot.
Yes, that would work out better. You know, maybe we could take a survey to see how that works for everyone.
Good idea! We'll have to get right on it. Fine! Well, I'll get right on it now!
I think that the company retreat should be in the mountains this year. What a great idea!
January would be a good month for a mountain retreat. I like the mountain idea, but I am not so sure about the month of January.
You know, now that I think about it, you might be right. April might be nice. It is far enough away to make the necessary arrangements.
That is a good suggestion. We could ask everyone what would be the best time for them.
Yes, that would let us know what would work best. I'll put the survey online this afternoon.
The Mountains would be a great place for the company retreat. That's a wonderful choice.
I have chosen January as the month for this retreat. January is a little too close to the Christmas holidays.
Yes, maybe another choice might be better. I think that April would work. Spring is a lovely time to be in the mountains.
Thank you for thinking of that. Maybe if we asked around we could see what people would prefer.
That is a good idea. I'll take care of taking the survey and get back to you with the answers.
Excuse me. I was wondering how to order office supplies. We have a requisition form on the company web site. What type of supplies do you need?
I need paper, ink cartridges, and paper clips. How quickly will you need your supplies?
I need all of my supplies right away. We also will have to check your department budget. Do you know how much money you have for office supplies?
I will check to see what my budget is. Would you like these supplies delivered or would you like to pick them up?
Please deliver them to my office. Fine, well just send the form to us and we will let you know as soon as your supplies come in. Have a good day!
I need help in ordering my office supplies. You can print out a copy of the Order Supply Form from our company web site and turn it into me. What will you be needing?
I need ink cartridges, staples, and Post-its.  Will you need all of them right away or can some wait?
Some of these can wait but there are a few things that I need right away. You can only buy supplies that you have a budget for. Do you know what your budget is?
We have plenty of money for office supplies. You can pick these supplies up or they can be delivered to your building. Which would you prefer?
I want to pick them up. Well, just finish the request and we will contact you when the supplies come in. Have a good day!
How do I order the office supplies that I need? Fill out this form with whatever you need. What do you need the most?
I need many things. I can get a few of them right away, but might have to order some.
I can wait a few days for these items. Make sure that you have money allocated for these supplies. How much do you have for office supplies?
I don't think we have very much money for supplies, but we have a little. Would you like them delivered to you or can you come get them here?
I am not sure yet. When you finish completing the request form, we will order and let you know when the supplies are here. Have a great day!
I'm hungry. So am I.
Where should we go eat today? How about we go eat in the cafeteria?
I never bought food from the cafeteria. You haven't? They have a lot of good stuff.
What do they have? They sell everything.
I want Chinese food. I've gotten chow mein from there before.
I guess we can eat there then. Trust me, the food isn't half bad.
I am starving. Let's go get something to eat.
Is there somewhere you wanted to go eat at? We can always go to the cafeteria and eat.
I haven't eaten there before. The food there is pretty good.
What kind of food do they serve? You can get whatever you want at the cafeteria.
I have a taste for Chinese food. They have really good chow mein.
Let's go to the cafeteria. It'll be fine.
I am absolutely famished. Yeah. I am too.
Where did you want to go for lunch? I was thinking we should just go to the cafeteria.
I don't think I ever got food from the cafeteria. I actually like the food there.
Does the cafeteria sell a lot of different food? They have anything you want.
I was thinking about getting some Chinese food. I bought some chow mein at the cafeteria. It tasted great.
We can eat at the cafeteria. I think you'll really like the food there.
I am here for my job interview. Fine, have a seat. May I get you some water or coffee?
Sure, thank you. I'll get that for you right now.
Thank you. What a nice office this is! Yes, could you come in now? I am going to take you back to meet your interviewer, Mr. Gotcha.
I have an appointment for an interview today. Great, have a seat. Would you like some tea or coffee?
I'd love some. The coffee area is right over there. Please help yourself.
Thank you. What a beautiful view from this office! Yes. Oh, here comes Mr. Gotcha now. I'll show you to his office.
Good morning. I have an interview scheduled this morning. The interviewer will be with you in a moment. Would you care for some water?
Yes, that would be great. Just help yourself to whatever you would like from the table in the waiting area.
Thank you. This is a very lovely office building! Yes. Why don't you come straight through the door and we'll walk down to Mr. Gotha's office together.
What do you feel like eating this morning? I usually just have a bowl of cereal.
The most important meal of the day is breakfast. Yeah, but I don't usually have time to eat a big breakfast.
You can always make an easy breakfast. What do you make?
All I make is oatmeal, toast, and some orange juice. That sounds pretty good.
I like it, and it's a fast meal. That is a very quick meal to make.
I can make it for you if you like. Oatmeal and toast sounds good to me.
What are you going to have for breakfast? I just have some cereal each morning.
You're supposed to always have a hearty breakfast. I don't always have time to make breakfast.
It's easy to make a quick breakfast. What do you have for breakfast?
When I need to make a quick breakfast, I just make some oatmeal, toast, and OJ. That's a good idea.
It's not time consuming at all. It doesn't take much time to make?
Would you like me to make something? Why don't you make me some oatmeal and toast?
What do you want to eat for breakfast? All I usually have is some cereal for breakfast.
You know that breakfast is the most important meal of the day? I sometimes run late in the morning, and can't make breakfast.
That's not a good excuse. Tell me what you eat in the morning.
I just eat some oatmeal, toast, and orange juice. That sounds like a great breakfast.
It's good, and it's easy to make. That sounds like a very quick meal.
So, are you still going to have cereal? I think I'm going to make myself some oatmeal and toast.
What are you doing this weekend? I am not sure. What are you doing?
I was thinking of maybe taking a drive to the beach. That sounds like a great idea!
Would you be interested in joining me? Sure, I would love to go with you. When would you be leaving?
I thought that we could leave around 8:00 on Saturday morning. That would give us plenty of time to explore. Did you know that there is a music festival on the beach in Santa Barbara?
That was part of my plan. Well then, I'll see you on Saturday. Thanks for asking me to go with you.
Do you have any plans for the weekend? I haven't given it much thought. What were you thinking of doing?
I was planning on taking a trip up the coast to the beach. What a perfect thing to do on a beautiful weekend!
Would you like to come along? I think I would enjoy that a lot. When would we leave?
Saturday morning around 8:00. Good. That would get us there with time to look around. There is a music festival in Santa Barbara on the beach that day.
Yes, I was hoping to be able to go to the festival. I am so glad we talked. Thank you for inviting me to the beach with you.
Have you thought about what you might like to do this weekend? I have no idea. Do you have any ideas?
If the weather stays nice, I'd like to go to the beach. That would be a good choice. The weather has been great for the beach!
Why don't you come with me? Hey, that would be perfect! What time are you leaving?
I think that Saturday morning around 8:00 would work out well. Santa Barbara has a music festival on the beach that day. We would have enough time to drop in and see it.
Yes, I knew the festival would be there and was looking forward to going to it. I am really looking forward to Saturday. Thank you for letting me go with you.
I was thinking about applying for the new position. Do you think that is a good idea?
It seems like a good idea but I am not really sure. What are your main concerns?
It would give me a chance to grow, but I am wondering if I would like the job. I know what you mean, I've thought about that myself.
I also am thinking about the pay. Could you take a slight pay decrease for a chance to move forward?
Yes, it might be worth it. I am not certain. I think I'm convinced that trying for this position is the best choice for you.
I am not certain, but I think I might ask to be considered for the new job. Why are you considering trying for it?
I think that I might like it, but I am still thinking about it. What is it about this job that appeals to you?
I think that I would enjoy the position but there isn't a lot of creativity involved. Yes, you could be right. There is a lot to consider.
I am also wondering about the pay. Would a slight decrease in pay be worth it for a new opportunity for growth?
I am thinking that might be the case. I think you should give it a shot. What do you have to lose? You can always change yourmind.
I am considering going for the new job that was posted yesterday. Are you certain that that is what you want to do.
It may not be the best choice for me, but I am considering it. Why do you think that this would be a good move?
I believe that this job would allow me to move up but might be a little boring for me. Yes, there are always pros and cons to making a career change.
Also, the matter of pay is also a consideration. I think the slight pay decrease might be worth it. The benefits are much better.
Yes, sometimes giving up a little to move forward is the best choice. I think you definitely should apply for the position.
What can I help you with today? My washing machine isn't working.
What's the problem? The water will not drain.
Is there anything else wrong with it? No, that's it.
I can come down and fix that for you if you'd like. When will you be able to fix it?
How does this afternoon at 2:30 sound to you? That would be perfect.
Alright, so I'll see you then? See you then.
How may I help you? Something is wrong with my washing machine.
Tell me the problem. For some reason, the water won't drain.
That's the only problem with it? That's the only problem.
Would you like me to come fix it for you? Yes. When can you come fix it?
I can be there by 2:30 today. That would be great.
I'll see you at 2:30. See you later. Thanks a lot.
Did you need help with something? I'm having a problem with my washing machine.
What is wrong with it? The water isn't draining from it.
Is that the only problem? Everything else is working fine.
I'm available if you'd like me to come fix it. When exactly are you free?
I can come at about 2:30, this afternoon. Sounds good to me.
I'll see you this afternoon. Yes. Thank you.
Hello, this is Albert. Hi. I'm Jack. You called about the room for rent. Are you still interested?
Yes, I am. I was wondering if I could ask you a couple of questions.
Shoot. I just want to be sure that we get along.
I agree with you 100 percent--we must get along. Are you a party animal?
Oh, no. I'm a very quiet person. Great! Next: Are you neat or are you a slob?
I'm a pretty neat person. Are you a night owl or a day person?
Early to bed, early to rise. Finally, do you smoke?
Actually, I quit smoking four years ago. Excellent answers. Do you have any questions for me?
Just one: Is there a parking lot? Unfortunately, you have to park in the street.
Well, I'm desperate. I'll take it anyway. Great! Let me know when you're ready to move in.
I think it will be tomorrow if that's okay. No problem. I'll be here all day tomorrow.
Hello. You've reached Albert. I'm Jack. Are you still interested in renting a room? 
Yes, very much so. Would it be all right if I asked you some questions?
Fire away. I just want to make sure that we are compatible.
That's a good idea. We need to get along. Do you like to party?
I don't party, and I don't like people who do. Great! Now, are you a neat person, or do you leave trash all over?
One of my mottoes is to clean as you go. Do you sleep in or rise early?
I go to bed early, and I get up early. And last, are you a smoker?
I can't stand cigarette smoke. Excellent. Now, do you have any questions for me?
Only one. Where can I park my car? I hate to tell you, but it's street parking.
I don't like it, but I need an apartment now, so I'll take it. Great! Give me a call, and I'll help you move your stuff in.
Will tomorrow be okay with you? That sounds good. I'll see you tomorrow.
Hi, this is Albert. Hi, my name is Jack. You called about a room for rent. Are you still interested?
Yes, more than you know. I don't mean to pry, but could I ask you a couple of questions?
Ask away. I don't want us to be roommates who don't get along.
Yes, we must get along if we are going to be roommates. Is partying one of your priorities?
I'm a student. I don't have time to party. Very good. Now, do you clean up after yourself?
I clean up my own mess, and I expect others to do so, too. What time do you usually hit the sack?
Occasionally, I stay up late if there's a big test the next day. What about smoking?
If I ever get elected President, I will ban smoking nationwide. Very good. Now, would you like to ask me anything?
Yes, I have one question. Do I have to park in the street? I'm sorry. Yes, you have to park your car in the street.
I hate street parking, but I need the apartment now. Very good. Just call me when you're ready to move your stuff over here.
How about if I come over tomorrow afternoon? Just ring the doorbell. I'll be here all day.
Hello, Albert speaking. This is Jack. Are you still interested in renting a room?
Oh, yes. Would you mind answering a couple of questions?
No problem. Since we might be roommates, I want to make sure there's no friction.
You are right. We need to be compatible. Do you go out to clubs or bars a lot?
I have been to only one nightclub in my whole life. Good. Now, do you expect others to pick up after you?
Occasionally I might slip up, but usually I'm clean and neat. What kind of hours do you keep?
The early bird gets the worm. I hope you're not a smoker.
I can smell a cigarette from a mile away. It makes me gag. Your answers are great. Now, do you have a question or two for me?
Just one question. What's the parking situation? This place allows only one parking space per apartment, so you'll have to park on the street.
I don't like it, but I guess I can live with it. Okay, I think we'll be good roommates. Just call me when you're ready to move in.
I can move in by tomorrow afternoon. That's fine. I was planning on being home tomorrow anyway.
Hello, Albert here.  Hi, Albert. I'm Jack. Are you still thinking about renting a room? 
Yes, I need a room badly. Can I ask you a few questions?
I'm an open book. I want to make sure that we get along okay.
I'm with you. We both need to live in harmony. Do you like to drink and party?
I hate noise, and I hate loud people. Excellent. Now, do you leave a trail of trash wherever you go?
A place for everything, and everything in its place. Do you keep normal hours?
I'm usually asleep before the 11 o'clock news. You don't have a cigarette habit, do you?
Cigarette smoking is the dumbest habit in the world. I like your answers. Now, are there any questions you'd like to ask me?
Yes, is the parking off street, or on street? You're not going to like this. It's street parking only.
That figures, nothing is perfect. But, I'll take it. You know, I think we're going to hit it off. Call me when you're coming over.
I can get all packed tonight and be there tomorrow. Just come on over anytime. I'll be here the whole day.
Did you need help with something? I don't know where to get my ballot.
I can help you with that. How can you help me?
I work here. That's great.
May I see your ID? Here it is.
All right, here is your ballot card. What do I do now?
Go to a voting booth and vote. All right. Thanks for your help.
May I help you? I'm not sure where to pick up my ballot.
I can assist you. How are you going to help me?
I actually work here. Fabulous. Thanks.
Do you have ID? I have it right here.
Here's your ballot card. Now what am I supposed to do?
Just take it to a booth and begin voting. Sounds good. Thanks.
Did you need help? Where do I go to pick up my ballot?
I'll help you with that. How's that?
I'm working here today. That's wonderful. Thank you.
Can I see your ID, please? Here you go.
I have your ballot card right here. What am I supposed to do now?
All you have to do now is vote. Okay. Wish me luck.
I am having some plumbing problems and need them fixed. What exactly is wrong with the plumbing?
The toilet flushes really slowly. Are there any problems with the plumbing in the kitchen?
Both the kitchen and the bathroom plumbing are messed up. How long have you had these problems?
It has been going on for a while, but just started to get worse this morning. I will send someone out to take a look at the problem. Will you be home this afternoon?
Yes, I will be home this afternoon. Fine. I will be there around 2:00. If someone is not there, I will use my key to get in.
I just moved into my apartment, and the plumbing is not working. Can you describe the plumbing problems you are having?
The bathtub barely drains at all. Okay, the bathroom plumbing needs looking at. What about the kitchen plumbing?
Neither the kitchen nor the bathroom plumbing is working well. Has this problem been going on for a long time?
It just started happening last night. I will be coming over to look at it this afternoon. Will you be there?
I will not be home. I can always use my key to get in, but I would prefer that you be there.
The plumbing in my new apartment is not working. I need you to tell me what the problem is.
The bathroom sink is stopped up. Is the kitchen plumbing messed up also, or just the bathroom plumbing?
Just the bathroom plumbing seems to have a problem. Did this just start happening, or has it been going on for a while?
Everything worked beautifully until a few hours ago. Are you going to be home so I can come by and take a look at the problem?
I am not sure if I will be home later. I will be coming by around 10 this morning. If you aren't there, I'll just use my key.
I am your waitress, Mary. Hello, Mary. We are all pretty hungry tonight!
While you are looking over the menu, can I interest you in an appetizer? An appetizer sounds good. Do you have a special menu?
They are listed on the first page of the menu. The coconut shrimp looks good. Have you ever had that?
Yes, it is excellent! Good, I'll take that then.
Would you like to split that and choose another appetizer for half price to share? Good. In that case, we'll also take an order of onion rings. Thank you!
My name is Mary, and I will be your waitress tonight. Thank you, Mary. We have been looking forward to trying out this restaurant.
Before your main course, would you like to order an appetizer? Sure, that sounds great. Where are your appetizers listed?
There is a special appetizer menu right here in the center of the table. The chicken and cheese quesadilla looks good. Is that pretty good?
You know, that is one of my favorites! OK, I'll take one order of that.
You could choose another appetizer for half price to share. Perfect! Please add on an order of onion rings.
My name is Mary, and I will be your server this evening. Hi Mary. We are really looking forward to a great meal here.
Can I interest you in an appetizer to start out? I would love an appetizer. Are they listed in the menu?
We have our daily appetizers listed on the board over there on the wall. I am thinking about the popcorn shrimp. How is that?
That would be a great choice! I'll trust your taste and take one order of that.
We have a special where you can order a second appetizer for half price. In that case, we'll take an order of onion rings with our first choice.

What kind of public transportation is near your apartment? I'm not sure, but I believe there is a bus stop about three blocks away.
Do you know what direction that bus travels? I'm sorry. If you check online, you can get that kind of information.

Can you give me a little more information about your apartment? All right, what do you need to know?
What is the public transportation like near your apartment? I don't use buses, but I think there's a bus stop a few blocks away.
Which route does the bus travel? I wish I could help you, but I know nothing about the bus system.
I'll just check my phone book. It has lots of good information. I'm sorry I couldn't help you more.
I was hoping you could give me more information about the apartment for rent. I can certainly try.
Do buses or trains run by the apartment? I can't swear to it, but I think a bus stop is a couple of blocks away.
Where does the bus take you? I don't want to lead you astray. You should check online.
My neighbor takes the bus. I'll ask him if he knows. Bus line information should be pretty easy to find.
Could you give me a little more information about the apartment? Sure, if I can. What do you want to know?

I'd like to return this radio. Okay. Do you have your receipt?
I lost it. I am sorry, but you need a receipt for a refund.
But I purchased it yesterday. Perhaps you would like to talk to customer service.
That's a start, I guess. They're right upstairs.
That sounds good. I'll take the escalator. Good luck. I hope someone can help you.
I want to return this radio. Okay. Do you have your receipt?
I'm sorry, but I lost it. I'm sorry, but store policy requires a receipt.
But I bought it yesterday. Maybe you can find the receipt if you look harder.
Can I talk to a supervisor? May I suggest customer service, upstairs?
That sounds good. I'll take the elevator right now. Good luck.
Can I return this radio, please? Sure. Do you have your receipt?
I misplaced it somewhere. Unfortunately, I cannot give you a refund without it.
But I bought it right here just yesterday. I'm sorry, but there are no exceptions.
Someone must be able to help me. Someone in customer service might be able to help you.
Yes, if anyone can help me, it's customer service. Just take the escalator upstairs.
I don't want to keep this radio. No problem. May I have your receipt, please?
Sorry. I could not find it. We can't give you a refund without a receipt.
You know, I bought it at 3 p.m. yesterday. I wish I could help you, but it's store policy.
Every rule has an exception. Perhaps if you try customer service.
Yes, they might be able to help me. They're upstairs. Good luck!
I'm returning this radio. Certainly. Can I see your receipt, please?
I looked everywhere, but I couldn't find it anywhere. I'm sorry, but you can't return the radio without your receipt.
Even though I just bought it yesterday? Are you sure that you looked everywhere for the receipt?
I looked everywhere, twice! Well, customer service is right upstairs. Maybe they can help.
Great! I'll take the escalator. If they can't help you, nobody can.
It's an ugly day today. I know. I think it may rain.
It's the middle of summer, it shouldn't rain today. That would be weird.
Yeah, especially since it's ninety degrees outside. I know, it would be horrible if it rained and it was hot outside.
Yes, it would be.  I really wish it wasn't so hot every day. 
Me too. I can't wait until winter. I like winter too, but sometimes it gets too cold.
I'd rather be cold than hot. Me too.
It doesn't look very nice outside today. You're right. I think it's going to rain later.
In the middle of the summer, it shouldn't be raining. That wouldn't seem right.
Considering that it's over ninety degrees outside, that would be weird. Exactly, it wouldn't be nice if it started raining. It's too hot.
I know, you're absolutely right. I wish it would cool off one day.
That's how I feel, I want winter to come soon. I enjoy the winter, but it gets really cold sometimes.
I know what you mean, but I'd rather be cold than hot. That's exactly how I feel.
I wish it was a nicer day today. That is true. I hope it doesn't rain.
It wouldn't rain in the middle of the summer. It wouldn't seem right if it started raining right now.
It would be weird if it started raining in ninety degree weather. Any rain right now would be pointless.
That's right, it really would be. I want it to cool down some.
I know what you mean, I can't wait until it's winter. Winter is great. I wish it didn't get so cold sometimes though.
I would rather deal with the winter than the summer. I feel the same way.
Are you going to vote on Tuesday? Of course. How about you?
I've already voted. How's that?
I sent in an absentee ballot. Why?
I won't be able to vote on Tuesday. Why not?
I have to work. Why don't you go to work late?
I have important business to take care of that morning. I see.
Will you be voting? Yes. Will you?
I already have. How did you do that?
I mailed in an absentee ballot. Why is that?
I can't vote on Tuesday. What's the reason for that?
I have to go to work. You can just go to work after you vote.
I need to take care of some business that morning. I get it now.
Do you plan on voting this Tuesday? Yes. What about you?
I already voted. What do you mean you already voted?
I had to mail in an absentee ballot. Why'd you have to do that?
I'm not going to be able to vote this Tuesday. Why is that?
I have to work this Tuesday. You can always go to work late.
That same morning I have some business to take care of. Oh, I understand.
I'm glad these batteries are on sale. I'm sorry. These batteries are not on sale.
But that's what the ad says. I'm sorry. If you look at the ad again, you'll see that the other brand is on sale.
You're right. I misread the ad. Yes, many people make that mistake.
You can't blame them. It's a confusing ad. You're right. Many ads are like that.
As long as I'm here. Just one second, and I'll get you the batteries that are on sale.
It's about time these batteries went on sale. I'm sorry. These aren't on sale today.
You're kidding me. The ad says they're on sale. Yes, the other brand of batteries is on sale.
I see. I've got the wrong brand. Yes, it's an easy mistake to make.
The ad is written in a misleading way. I agree. It seems like all ads are meant to confuse you.
It's not the first or last time. Hold on, and I'll get you the batteries that are on sale.
You don't often find these batteries on sale. I'm not sure that these batteries are on sale today.
But the ad says they're on sale. Yes, batteries are on sale, but not this brand.
What do you know? I picked up the wrong brand. Yes, several customers have made that mistake today.
Like many ads, it's deliberately confusing. I couldn't agree more. They write ads just to get you into the store.
I should know better by now. If you can wait one minute, I'll bring you the batteries that are on sale.
This is the first time I've seen these batteries on sale. I'm sorry, but they aren't on sale today.
Look at the ad. The ad says they're on sale. Yes, the ad says that the other brand of batteries is on sale.
Yes, I misread the ad. Believe me, you're not the first person to make that mistake today.
No wonder people make a mistake. The price is in big letters, and the brand is in tiny letters. You're right. You have to read an ad two or three times sometimes.
You have to be careful with every ad you read. It's okay. I'll go get you the batteries that are on sale.
These batteries should be on sale more often. I don't think these batteries are on sale.
Look at the ad. It says they're on sale. You're right. Batteries are on sale, but not this brand of batteries.
I didn't pay attention to the brand name. Several people have misread that ad already today.
People make the mistake because the ad is misleading. I agree with you. Ads can be very tricky.
I don't know when I'll ever learn. No problem. I'll bring you the batteries that are on sale. I'll be right back.

I am looking for a pan. No problem. What size would you like?
A big one would be nice. How about this one? It's our biggest-16 in diameter.
I like that one, but it's too heavy. Okay, try this one. It's made of aluminum.
This is much better. But it has an aluminum handle. Here you go. Same pan, but with a state-of-the-art, heat-resistant plastic handle.
That's perfect. I'll take it. Great. Will that be cash or charge?
Wait a minute. What about a lid for the pan? I'm sorry. I forgot to show you the lid. It comes with the pan.
I need a pan. Okay. Do you have a particular size in mind?
The bigger the better, I think. Look at this one. It's our biggest pan.
That is big enough, but it's too heavy for me. Okay, we have the same thing in aluminum.
This is nice and light. But it has an aluminum handle. Try this one. Same aluminum pan, but with a heat-resistant bamboo handle.
This is very nice. I'll take this one. That's a good choice. How do you want to pay for it?
Cash. Oh, I almost forgot. I need a lid, too. I'm so sorry. A lid comes with the pan. Here it is.
I'd like to purchase a pan. Is there any particular size that you want?
I cook a lot of big meals. What do you think of this one? It's a 16 pan.
That's the right size, but it's so heavy. Well, look at our aluminum pan. It's much lighter.
Yes, this is very light, but the handle is also aluminum. No problem. Look at this one. Same pan, but with a lightweight wooden handle.
Great. This is exactly what I was looking for. I'll buy it. I think you'll love this pan. Do you want to pay with cash?
Yes. Oh, wait a second, please. What about a lid? I'm sorry. I forgot to show it to you. Here it is. It comes with the pan.
Can you help me find a pan? Are you looking for a small, medium, or large pan?
I want a big pan. Does this one look big enough?
It's the right size, but it weighs too much. Well, what do you think of the aluminum pan?
It's light enough, but the handle will get too hot after cooking. Here's the same pan, but it has a space-age, heat-resistant plastic handle.
My family's going to love this one. I'll take it. I'm so happy that you found what you wanted. Do you want to use a credit card?
Sure. Wait, wait. Does a lid come with this pan? Oh, I'm sorry. Here's the lid. Yes, it comes with the pan.
I'm looking for a pan I can use in my kitchen. What size pan were you thinking of?
I've already got a small pan. I need a big one. Well, this one might work for you.
No, that's way too heavy a pan for me. Here, lift this aluminum pan. It's the same size.
Yes, it's very lightweight. But I don't want this aluminum handle. Here's a similar aluminum pan. But it has a heat-resistant handle.
This feels very nice. It's perfect. I'll take it. I knew we'd find the right pan sooner or later. How would you like to pay?
Cash. But first, I need a lid for this pan. Oh, no problem. Here's the lid that comes with the pan.

I would like to help with the computer work. Great! We are going to be working in teams of three. Are you OK working with others?
Yes, I like working like that. We will begin next Monday. Would you be available then?
Yes, I can be there. Well, if you could send me your basic background information before next Monday, it would be useful.
I will send the information to you. Well then, thanks for your help. Have a great day!
Would you like me to help you on your new project? I would love the help! Would you prefer helping with the writing part or is programming more your thing?
I would enjoy helping with the writing portion. Perfect! You'll be working alone on that portion. Do you like to work alone?
That is OK sometimes. Our first meeting is next Monday. Could you meet with us at that time?

Can you help me figure out where I should go first to check in at this airport? If you already have your ticket, we can take your bags here at the curbside check-in.
How do I know what gate to go to? There are arrivals and departures listed on the screens inside.
Is there someplace where I can find out what I can carry in my baggage? There are signs posted near the baggage check area to help you know what the rules are.
Can my friend go inside with me? Your friend can go with you to the ticket counter but not past the security check.
When I return, will this curbside area be a good place to get picked up? This area is only for departures. The bottom level is for arrivals.
I don't know the departure procedures at this airport and was wondering if you could help me. If you need to pick up your ticket, you need to go to the ticket counter right inside the door. They will check your bags for you.
I don't know where my plane is departing from. There are agents for your airline at the counter in the corner.
Where can I find out what I can carry on in my bag? There should be a list of restrictions printed on your ticket.
Can I take my friend along with me to say goodbye? Only ticketed passengers can go past the security checkpoint.
Is this the area for departures and arrivals or only departures? This is the drop-off area for departures. Arrivals are on the lower level.
I am flying out today and need to know where I should begin checking in. If you only have a carry-on and already have a ticket, you may proceed directly to the gate to check in.
Do you know what gate my plane is leaving from? Check on the screens when you go through baggage inspection for your airline.
I need to know what the restrictions are for carry-on luggage contents. Check out the list of banned carry-on materials on the signs inside the airport.
I have a lot of time to kill before my flight departs and want my friend to keep me company. For security purposes, only ticketed passengers can go to the gate.
Can my friends pick me up here when I return? The curbside area is a departure area only. Arrivals are downstairs.

Yes, I want to see it. How about today at 6 p.m.?
That time is okay with me. Very good. We'll meet at 6. Do you need directions?
No, thank you. I go by there on my way to work. If you're interested, you can fill out an application form.
That's a good idea. Do I need to bring anything myself? No. The only thing I need to see is your driver's license.
I'd like to speak with the apartment manager, please. This is he. What can I do for you?
I'm interested in the apartment on Main Street. It's still available. Do you want to see it?
Yes, I would very much like to see it. Does today at 6 p.m. sound okay to you?
I have no problem with 6 p.m. Okay, I'll see you at 6 o'clock. Do you need any directions?
No, thanks. I already drove by to see what the neighborhood looks like. I'll have an application form with me. You can fill it out if you're interested.
Should I bring anything with me? No. I only need to check your driver's license.
May I speak to the apartment building manager, please? I'm the manager. How can I help you?
I was hoping that the apartment on Main Street was still available. Why, yes, it is. Would you like to get a look inside the apartment?
Yes, it would be nice to see the apartment. How about today at 6 o'clock?
Yes, I can be there at 6. Sounds good. I'll see you at 6. Do you want directions?
I'm okay, thank you. I already checked out the address on MapQuest. If you like the place, you can fill out an application form. I'll bring one with me.
Is there anything that I need to bring with me? No. I won't need to see anything except your driver's license.
I really like the apartment, but I was wondering if I could change some things. What would you like to change?
I would like to have different carpet. I would be willing to put in a different color carpet if you pay the price difference.
How much more would it cost? It would cost between 2 and 10 dollars more per square yard.
While I am at it, would it be possible to switch paint colors? I would be willing to look at a different color. You need to bring me a sample.
When can my apartment be painted and ready to go? You can have the new carpet and paint by next Monday.
This apartment is great, but could I upgrade a few things? What are you unhappy with?
I want to have a different color carpet. If you agree to pay more money, you could upgrade the carpet.
Would it cost a lot more? It could be as little as 2 dollars or as much as 10 dollars more per square yard.
I was also wondering if it would be possible to pick a different paint color. Bring me a paint sample to look at, and I will consider it.
When can you finish with the new carpet and paint? Your new apartment can be recarpeted and repainted by next Tuesday.
I think that I would enjoy living here, but I would like to make improvements. What would make this apartment better for you?
I think that it would look better with a better quality carpet. You can have a different carpet, but you have to pay more if it costs more.
How much more would it cost to upgrade? It could vary quite a bit, between 2 and 10 dollars per square yard.
Do you think that I could have a different paint color in my apartment? I have to see a sample. Bring me one this week, please.
How long will it take for my new apartment to be ready? Both the new paint and new carpet will be finished by next week.
What can I do for you today? Doctor, I have the worst toothache!
How long have you had this pain? For about a week or so, but it's gotten really bad in the last couple of days.
Did you do anything that might have aggravated your tooth? You know, I was eating jawbreakers in the movies the other day, and I accidentally bit down really hard on one.
What kind of toothbrush do you use? I just use a regular hard bristle toothbrush.
Does it bother you when you eat something really cold? Yes, it definitely bothers me more when I do that.
So what brings you to my office today? My tooth is killing me!
How long has your tooth been bothering you? It just started hurting me last night.
Have you injured your tooth in any way? I think one of my fillings might be coming loose.
Do you have a special kind of toothbrush that you like to use? I have an electric toothbrush.
Does it bother you when you eat something really sweet? Oh yeah, when I do that, it hurts a lot more!
How have you been doing? I can't sleep or eat. I have a really bad pain in my tooth!
How long have you had this toothache? It bothers me off and on, but it's gotten much worse these past few weeks.
Is there anything that you've done to your tooth that might have caused the pain? My girlfriend told me that I grind my teeth a lot when I sleep. Maybe that is the problem.
When you brush your teeth, what do you use? I use a soft bristle toothbrush.
Does it bother you when you have to chew a lot? Absolutely. That set it off big time!
What are you working on? I'm figuring out my budget.
What budget? I'm making a shopping budget, so that I don't spend too much money.
How much money can you spend? I can only spend $300 a month.
Why only $300? I need to save the rest.
For what? I need to pay my bills.
Your budget is a good idea. I know. It's going to save me a lot of money, I hope.
What are you trying to do? I'm working on a budget.
What kind of budget? I need to budget my shopping so that I don't spend all my money.
What's your budget? I can spend about $300 per month.
Why so little? The rest of my money needs to be saved.
What do you need to save up for? I still need to pay my bills.
You're wise for saving your money. I think it's just common sense.
What are you doing? I'm trying to figure out my budget.
What do you need a budget for? I need to put a limit on my spending.
What's your spending limit? I'm only allowed to spend $300 each month.
That's not much. Because, I need to save the rest of my money.
What are you saving for? I have bills to pay for too.
It's good that you are being smart with your money. It's about time that I started being smart.
I would like to speak with the manager about some safety concerns. This is the manager. What can I do for you?
I was parking my car last night in the garage area, and it was very dark out there. Is this the first time you noticed this?
The lighting has always been bad, but it seems to be getting worse. We are trying to save electricity, so we put in new energy-saving bulbs. Maybe that was the problem.
Whatever the problem is, it needs to be fixed. Why do you feel this is so unsafe?
It is unsafe because it allows people to hide in there and jump people and rob them. I will go out there after dark and check it out. Thanks for bringing it to my attention.
Could I speak with the property manager about a problem I had last night? I am the property manager. What was the problem that you experienced?
Have you noticed that the lighting in the garage area is almost nonexistent? Has this been a problem for you in the past?
I just moved here recently, so I really don't know how long it has been like this. Maybe some of the bulbs were burned out.
All I know it that it feels very unsafe out there at night. Do you really think it is that unsafe to have a few dark patches here and there?
It is unsafe because a rapist could hide in there and attack women. I will have the night manager look into it. Thank you for telling me about it.
I had a problem last night in the parking lot and would like to speak to the manager. This is the manager speaking. How can I help you?
I got out of my car in the parking area, and the area was not lit very well. How long have you noticed this problem?
This is the first time that I noticed it. Maybe you were just parking in a shadowy area.
Regardless of the cause, the problem needs to be taken care of. I am not sure that having a few shadows here and there is such a problem.
It is unsafe because people can't see where they are walking and could have an accident. When it gets dark tonight, I will take a look. I appreciate your concern.
Could you tell me how to get my bags? Just go straight ahead, down the escalator, and there will be signs directing you.
Where do we clear Customs? You will pick your bags up first.
Should we have our passports out? You should have your passport out and your Declarations form totally filled out before you get into line.
My friend here is continuing on to Puerto Rico, and we were wondering if she has to go through Customs. Travelers who are continuing on to another country will check in over there and be directed where to go next. Their bags have been checked through.
Are there any restrooms in this area? Yes, right over there after you pass through the line.
I have never arrived at this airport before and need to know where to go next. Go to the end of the walkway, down the stairs, and to the right.
Do we need to clear Customs before we go get our bags? You will clear Customs and Immigration when you have picked up your luggage.
What do I need to have out when I pass through Customs? Make sure that your passport is out and that your Declarations form is complete.
My seatmate here is traveling through to Canada, and I told her that she probably doesn't have to clear Customs. People who are not entering the United States should go to the left and follow the directions given to them. Their bags are already routed through to their final destination.
Can we use the restrooms before we clear Customs? Yes, there is one right over there especially for this area.
Where is the luggage claim area? You can get to Baggage Claim by going down the escalator and following the signs.
Don't I have to clear Customs before I go get my bags? After you have picked up your bags, you will be directed to Customs.
Do I need to have this Declarations form filled out before I get there? Do not get in the Customs and Immigration line until you have your passport out with your completed Declarations form.
My brother won't be staying in the U.S. but is continuing on to Mexico. Passengers continuing on should check in with the attendant on the left who will direct them to where they can connect with their next flight.
Is there a restroom we can use in this area? Of course, right over there on your left.
I really need to start eating healthier. I have to start eating better too.
What kind of food do you usually eat? I try my best to eat only fruits, vegetables, and chicken.
Is that really all that you eat? That's basically it.
How do you stick to only those foods? Actually, fruits and veggies are really good for you.
Yes, I know, but what about the chicken? I mainly eat baked chicken, because there's not a lot of fat.
That does sound pretty good. I know it does, and that's because it is.
I think I may try to eat a little better. I changed my diet recently, and I eat a lot healthier now.
What do you eat? My diet consists mainly of fruits, veggies, and chicken.
That's it? Just about.
How is that the only thing that you'll eat? You know that fruits and vegetables are very healthy foods?
So, what about the chicken? I bake chicken because it's a healthy way to eat it.
That sounds delicious and nutritious. You should try it. You won't be disappointed.
I need to stop eating such unhealthy foods. I know what you mean. I've started eating better myself.
What foods do you eat now? I tend to stick to fruits, vegetables, and chicken.
Those are the only things you eat? That's basically what I eat.
Why aren't you eating anything else? Well, fruits and vegetables are very healthy.
And the chicken? It's really healthy to eat when you bake it.
Did you hear the news? What happened?
Our cousin went into labor and had her baby last week. She did? Why didn't anyone tell me?
I would've thought that somebody would have told you. No, I had no idea.
Well, she did, her baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces. Oh my God, that's great!
Are you going to go and visit her and the baby? I think that I might.
Good! I just thought I'd let you know. Thanks for telling me.
Have you heard what happened? Heard what?
Debrah already had her baby. I didn't know that.
I thought you knew. I honestly didn't know.
The baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces. That's good to hear.
Will you go and visit them? Of course I will.
I just wanted to give you the good news. Thanks for letting me know.
Have you heard the news? I haven't heard anything.
Debrah had her baby last week. Nobody told me.
I thought you heard. I really wasn't told anything.
She was a cute 8 pounds 6 ounces. Wow, how exciting.
I know, you should really go and see her and the baby. Of course I will.
I just wanted to let you know what happened. I appreciate that.
May I take your drink order while you are looking over your menu? Yes, do you have a wine list?
The wine list is on the second page of your menu. Do you have mixed drinks in this restaurant?
Yes, we have a full bar here. I am not sure what I want. Do you have any house specials?
Actually, we are famous for our Cuervo Gold margaritas. That sounds good! Please bring me one of those.
Would you like that drink blended or on the rocks? I would like it blended.
Would you like it with salt or no salt? I would like my margarita with no salt, thank you.
While you are thinking about what you might like to order for dinner, would you like to order your drinks? Can you tell me where your wine list is?
The wine list is posted right there on the board. Can we order a mixed drink in this restaurant?
Yes, we have a wide selection of mixed drinks available from our bar. Do you have any house specials that you could recommend?
Our most popular drinks are our Cuervo Gold margaritas. That sounds like a good choice for me. May I have one, please?
Can I bring that to you on the rocks, or would you like it blended? Please bring it to me on the rocks.
Salt or no salt? I would like it with no salt, please.
Can I take your drink order? Where is your wine list?
The wine choices are posted on the little menu in the middle of the table. Do you have any mixed drinks available here?
We can make a number of mixed drinks at our bar. I heard that you are famous for your drinks. What are your specials?
Our house special is our Cuervo Gold margarita. I would love a margarita right now! That is what I am going to order.
Can I prepare your drink on the rocks, or would you prefer it blended? I prefer my margarita on the rocks, please.
Do you like your margarita with salt or no salt? No salt, please.
Did you hear who won the election? I can't believe that Obama won.
I couldn't be happier to know that he's our new President. I know! He just made history!
You voted for him, right? I did. Did you?
I voted for him. I am so happy that he is our new President!
So am I. I hope that he brings change to America.
I have faith in him. I have faith in our new President.
You know who won the election, right? I'm still shocked that Obama was elected.
I couldn't believe it, either. He just made history.
I hope you voted for him. Of course I did. Did you?
I made sure to vote for him. I am really excited about this.
I know how you feel. Hopefully, he'll change things in our nation.
I know that he will. I trust him.
You heard who won the election, didn't you? Yeah. I am so excited that Obama won.
I'm so happy that he did. That man just made history.
Did you vote for him? I sure did! What about you?
Of course I did! I am still in shock to know that he was elected.
I am, too! I pray that he actually makes things better in this country.
I'm sure that he will. I know he will, too.
I really need to go shopping. What do you need to buy?
I need to look for a new bedroom set. Where are you going to go look for one?
I have absolutely no idea. You don't know where you want to look for one?
I'm not sure where they sell nice bedroom sets. Do you want to know where I got mine from?
Yes, because I love yours. I purchased mine from IKEA.
Is IKEA affordable? Not at all, but you get what you pay for.
I have to do some shopping. What are you going to look for?
I'm trying to buy a new bedroom set. What store are you going to?
I'm not sure. You don't know?
I have no idea where to find one. Would you like me to tell you where I got mine.
I would appreciate that. I went to get mine from IKEA.
Is the furniture at IKEA cheap? They're not cheap, but neither is their furniture.
I'm going to have to do some shopping today. Oh yeah? What do you need to go shopping for?
I want to find a new bedroom set. Do you know where you're going to find your bedroom set?
I have no clue. There's no particular place that you want to look at?
I don't know where to go to find a nice bedroom set. I can tell you where I got mine, if you'd like.
Please do. I bought mine from IKEA.
Are the bedroom sets at IKEA affordable? Not really, but you're paying for quality.
Thank you for coming to look at my house. I really wanted to take a look and help give you an idea of what we need to do.
When will people come to look at my house? Basically, there are two ways people can view your home. They can come to an Open House or they can come with a Realtor to view it during a private appointment.
Will people from other real estate offices be involved, or just from your office? Your house is going to be listed as a Multiple Listing so that it will have the maximum exposure to a variety of people.
Will I know when people are going to come see my house? We will set the parameters in the contract, but usually you will receive at least four hours of notification that someone is coming.
What happens during an Open House day? You will be expected to be away during an Open House. I will take care of the details.
I appreciate you dropping by to look at my home. It is useful for us to take a walk through your home together, so that we make sure that we are on the same page.
How do you show my home to potential buyers? We will have an Open House or two on a weekend and we also will show your home with private appointments during the week.
Are you the only real estate office that will be showing my house? We are placing your house as a Multiple Listing. That way, people who don't work for my particular office can show your home to their clients.
How will I know when to expect prospective buyers? That will be set in your contract. Usually, you will be given four hours notice.
Can I stay home during an Open House day? The seller is never at home during an Open House. I personally will handle the showing of your home.
Thanks for stopping by to evaluate my home. I want to make sure that you are very clear on what the steps are to selling a home.
When can people come and see my home? We will have several Open House weekends. Various realtors will also show your house during the week.
Will I know all of the realtors who will be showing my home, or will they be strangers? Your house will be listed on what we call a Multiple Listing. That way it will be shown by a variety of realtors.
Can people just drop in anytime they feel like it? We usually try and give you at least four hours of notification that someone is coming to look at your home.
Will I have to go away during an Open House day? I will handle all of the work involved for the Open House. The only thing that you need to do is be somewhere else!
You're spending a very long time on my hair. I'm almost done.
I needed you to be finished an hour ago. I'm all done now.
Are you sure you're finished? I don't understand.
You did a horrible job on my hair. What's wrong with it?
I don't like anything about it. I apologize.
That's fine, but I'm not paying for it. Excuse me? Let's try to work this out, okay?
It's taking you forever to do my hair. Give me a minute.
You should've been done already. There you go.
I don't think that you're done. What's wrong?
My hair looks hideous. What's so bad about it?
It doesn't look good at all. Sorry about that.
I really hope that you didn't expect me to pay you for this. Well, let me talk to my manager, okay?
What's taking you so long? Don't worry. I'm almost finished.
I need you to hurry up. All right. I'm finished.
I think there's more you need to do. What do you mean by that?
My hair looks awful. What don't you like about it?
I just don't like my hair. I'm sorry that you don't like it.
I won't be paying you for this. I'm sure we can work something out.
I'd like to order dinner. What would you like?
I'd like to order a bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare. I'm sorry. We're currently out of filet mignon. May I suggest the porterhouse instead?
I'd prefer the filet, but the porterhouse will do. And may I suggest chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne?
Normally, I would take you up on that suggestion, but just the champagne will do for tonight. Okay, no strawberries. Room service will be charged to your amenities account. Is that all right?
That's fine. It will be up shortly. Enjoy your food, sir.
Could I order dinner? Of course. What would you like?
I want a bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare. I'm so sorry. We ran out of filet mignon. May I suggest the porterhouse instead?
That's too bad, but the porterhouse will be okay. May I be so bold as to suggest chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne?
Not tonight, thank you. No strawberries. We'll charge your amenities account, if that's okay.
Charge it to whatever account you like. Your meal will be delivered as soon as it's all ready. Enjoy!
Could you bring me some food, please? Sure. What do you fancy?
Can I have a bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare? Sir, the filet mignon was so popular tonight that we ran out. May I suggest the porterhouse?
No filet? Okay, porterhouse will be fine then. Perhaps you would like chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne?
Not tonight, but thank you for the suggestion. Okay. This will be charged to your amenities account, okay?
No problem. Your food will be brought to you momentarily. I hope you enjoy it.
I'd like you to bring me some food. Just name it, sir.
Please send up a bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare. Regrettably, we're currently out of filet mignon. May I suggest the porterhouse instead?
Sure, I love porterhouse, too. Would you be interested in chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne?
I'd love to, but I'm allergic to strawberries. Okay, no strawberries tonight. The items will be charged to your amenities account.
Go right ahead. Our staff will bring you your order in as short a time as possible.
I need something to eat, please. Tell me what you're hungry for.
I feel like champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare. Unfortunately, we're out of filet mignon at the moment. May I suggest the porterhouse instead?
I prefer filet, but porterhouse is good, too. Perhaps I could interest you in chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne?
Just the champagne will be fine, thank you. You'll see this charge on your amenities account.
That's fine. It won't be long until your food is delivered. I know you'll enjoy it.
Can I order something from the kitchen? Just tell me what you'd like, please.
A bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare would hit the spot. I hate to tell you this, but we have no more filet mignon. May I suggest the porterhouse instead?
Sure! Right now, I would even eat hamburger! Have you ever tried chocolate-covered strawberries with champagne? 
Thank you, but I just finished eating some chocolate-covered cherries.  That'll be a bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and porterhouse, all charged to your amenities account.
Not a problem. Please call if you have any other requests. Your food will be delivered promptly.
Pardon me. Could you help me? Of course. How can I help you?
I am looking for a sweater. What size do you wear?
Medium, I think. Here. How do you like this one?
It's pretty. Can I try it on? You can try it on in the fitting room over there.
Excuse me. Can you help me? Certainly. What can I do for you?
I need to purchase a sweater. What is your size?
Medium should be fine. Is this one okay?
Can I try it on somewhere? The fitting room is in the left corner.
May I ask you a question? Yes. How can I assist you?
I want to buy a sweater. What size?
I think a medium should fit me. How about this one?
The color's nice. Do you have a dressing room? There's a fitting room right over there.
Do you have a second? Sure. What do you need?
I'm here to buy a sweater. What size do you wear?
I usually wear medium. What do you think about this one?
It's nice. Where is your fitting room? The dressing room is in that corner.
Excuse me. Could you help me with something? I'll certainly try.
I'm looking for a nice sweater. What size do you wear in a sweater?
Medium is my size for shirts and sweaters. Here's a medium. What do you think?
I like it. Where can I try it on? We have a large fitting room in that corner.
Good morning. Thank you for the interview. No problem. Now, do you prefer working with others or flying solo?
Actually, I enjoy both. So, what is most important to you in a job? Do you need job security or professional growth and a chance to advance?
I need job security. Would you be able to relocate?
I am open to relocating. What are your annual salary requirements?
I need at least 75,000 per year. I'll keep that in mind. Thank you for coming in today. We'll be in touch.
Thank you so much for interviewing me this evening. Happy to meet with you. Now, do you prefer group projects?
I like to work alone on some things and then bring those things to the group. Do you value a steady job more or one that offers a chance to move ahead?
I want to grow in my job and move ahead. Could you work for us in another state, if need be?
I need to stay in the area because of family. How much do you need to make per year?
75,000 per year. Yikes! Thanks for your interest in this job. We'll be getting back to you.
I really appreciate the opportunity to interview for this position. I was wondering if you like team projects, or projects that you work on alone.
I like to work on group projects that value and need each individual's contributions. Are you most interested in a good steady job with benefits or one that will allow you to quickly advance?
I have children so a steady job is important but I would like a chance to advance. How would you feel about relocating to another state?
I could not relocate in the next year, but might be open to it in the future. Do you know how much this job offers per year?
A minimum of 75,000 per year. OK, well, that's all I need to know for now. If something comes up, we'll be contacting you.
What's for dinner tonight? What are you planning on cooking?
I'm not making anything. If you plan on eating, you are.
What am I supposed to cook? What do you feel like having?
I want some chicken and potatoes. That sounds really good.
When are you going to make it? I have no plans on cooking tonight.
Fine, I'll make it. I knew that already.
What are we going to eat for dinner? Are you going to cook anything?
I didn't plan on cooking tonight. If you're hungry, then cook something.
I don't know what to make. Tell me what you want to eat.
I've been craving chicken and potatoes. I'd like that.
Are you going to cook it tonight? I'm really not going to cook tonight.
I guess I'll cook. Why don't you start cooking then?
Are we going to have dinner tonight? What are you planning on making?
I'm not cooking dinner. The only way you're eating tonight is if you cook.
I'm not sure what to cook for dinner. I don't know. What do you want to eat?
I have a taste for some chicken and potatoes. That sounds delicious.
So are you planning on cooking it? I already told you that I'm not cooking tonight.
I'll cook dinner. I already know. Start cooking.
I'm not sure about how to operate the washer and dryer. What's the problem?
I need help turning them on. You need change.
The machines take change? Yes. It costs fifty cents for the washer and a dollar for the dryer.
How do I do it? You put the coins into the slot, push it in, and it will turn on.
That's it? There's nothing else to it.
Thank you very much. You're welcome. Let me know if you need anything else.
I need help using the washer and dryer. Tell me what the problem is.
I can't figure out how to turn them on. Do you have some quarters?
I didn't know I needed change. The washer costs 50 cents and the dryer costs a dollar.
Where do I put the change? The quarters go into the slot. You have to push the slot in, and the machine will turn on.
Is that everything that I have to do? That's all there is.
I appreciate you helping me with this. If you need anything else, just let me know.
Could you tell me how to use the washer and dryer? What do you need help with?
Do you know how to turn them on? Do you have any change?
I need change for the machines? You need to put 50 cents into the washer machine and a dollar into the dryer.
So what do I need to do? The machines will turn on once you put the quarters into the slot.
That's really all I have to do? That's everything.
Thanks for all your help. I'm here if you need any more help.
I have a little problem with room 507. What exactly seems to be the problem, Mr. Sandals?
I found cockroaches in my room. Cockroaches, sir? That's unbelievable.
I've seen at least nine different cockroaches in my room. Sir, are you sure you haven't seen the same silverfish nine times?
There are nine cockroaches in my room. I don't have time for your disbelief! I apologize. One moment, please, while I transfer you to my supervisor.
I'm in 507. I have a few problems with my room. What is that problem, sir?
There are cockroaches in my room. Are you sure, sir? Flies I could believe, but cockroaches?
I've counted nine different cockroaches, and I accidentally stepped on another one. Sir, we run a spotless and cockroach-less hotel.
You dare to doubt me? I'm sorry, sir. Let me transfer you to my supervisor.
There's a big problem with my room. I'm in 507. Would you tell me the nature of the problem, sir?
I have cockroaches crawling in my room. Perhaps you saw a silverfish, sir.
I've seen nine more cockroaches than I wanted to see. Sir, you haven't been drinking by any chance, have you?
How dare you question my statement! Forgive me. You're 100 percent correct. Allow me to transfer you to my supervisor.
There's a major problem with room 507. I'm sorry to hear that. Please tell me the exact problem.
This room is overrun with cockroaches. There has been an occasional silverfish in the hotel, sir.
I stopped counting at nine. Sir, this hotel just passed a thorough insect inspection with flying colors.
Your inspector needs spectacles. The fact is that cockroaches are running rampant. I apologize, sir. Just a second, while I transfer you to my supervisor.
I'm in 507, and I have a big problem.  I'm so sorry. Kindly tell me what the problem is, sir.
Everywhere I look, I see cockroaches. Perhaps you could look again, sir, to double-check.
The next cockroach I see will be number ten. Mr. Sandals, I've worked here five years without seeing one cockroach.
I've already suffered enough without listening anymore to you! You're right, sir. Please let me transfer you to my supervisor.
I have a little problem with room 507. Problems are what we're here for, sir. Please tell me your problem.
This room is filthy with cockroaches.  Were you wearing your glasses when you noticed them, sir?
I've already seen nine of them and, as they say, eight is enough!  Sir, sometimes a fast elevator ride makes our guests see spots.
You are not in a position to question my vision or my statement! I'm very sorry, sir. Will you please hold while I transfer you to my supervisor?
Could you help me try and figure out how to get ready for my job interview? The most important thing to do is to make sure you know the company and what services or products it provides. Do you know all about them?
Yes, I pretty much understand the company. Well, after you've done your research, you have to decide whether the company is casual or formal. Have you decided what they are yet?
Yes, I've been observing them. When you are choosing what to wear, keep all of that in mind. Have you chosen what to wear?
I already have something to wear. I would always be ready to go shopping with you! Should we talk about other basics?
I am ready to think of other things. You need to make sure you arrive on time, smile, be pleasant and friendly, look the person in the eye and answer all questions to the best of your ability. You'll do great!
I am not sure what to do to get ready for my job interview. Make sure that you understand the company. Do you understand what it is that they do?
No, I probably need to do some more research. When you've finished your research it will help you figure out whether your company is rigid in philosophy or kind of more relaxed. Does that make sense?
I think that their attitude is rather casual. So all of that information will help you to pick out what to wear. Do you have something to wear?
I have absolutely nothing so far. I could go shopping with you sometime if you need it, but can we talk about other basics?
Yes, where should we go from here? Focus on being relaxed and open, don't forget to smile and shake hands and be genuinely interested in what their company is about. I'm sure you'll do well.
What should I do to prepare for a job interview? An understanding of the basic workings of a company and the services or goods it provides is essential. Do you have that?
Sort of, but I could know more, I guess. With that understanding, you can figure out what your company is looking for in terms of basic attitude. Right?
I think that they are a very formal company. What you wear is important. So keep in mind what is suitable for the company and type of work you will be doing. Need help?
I need a lot of help in this area. In addition to clothes we need to think about other basics, OK?
Yes, what else should we think of? Be prompt. Don't forget to be friendly and interested. Listen carefully and listen to what they are really asking you. You'll be a hit!
Have you been having any problems lately? No, but the nurse at school says that I should have my blood pressure checked.
Do you have a history of high blood pressure? No, I have never been told that I have high blood pressure.
High blood pressure is called the silent killer because it hardly ever has symptoms.  How do you check for high blood pressure?
We are going to use this cuff here, and it will give me a reading. What do the numbers mean?
They tell me how much your heart is working at rest and when pumping blood. Good. That will help me know how I am doing.
How have you been feeling lately? I've been feeling a little light-headed lately.
Has your blood pressure been high before? If I have high blood pressure, it is news to me.
Usually people with high blood pressure have no symptoms, so we call it the silent killer. What do you use to check for high blood pressure?
I am going to put a cuff on you to get a reading. What does the reading tell you?
I get an idea of the pressure in your arteries when your heart is pumping blood versus at rest. I hope that the test results show me to be really healthy.
Have you been feeling OK lately? My coach wants you to check my blood pressure.
Has anyone ever told you that you had high blood pressure? I don't have any symptoms of high blood pressure.
People with high blood pressure seldom know they have it, which is why we call it the silent killer. What test do you do for high blood pressure?
We will pump air into this cuff to get a reading. When you get the reading, what information does it give you?
It tells me how hard your heart pumps blood and how much your arteries relax at rest. I am hoping that this test goes well for me.
Can you help me pick out a gift for my daughter? She might like a laptop computer.
That sounds like a good idea. Might I suggest a Mac?
How much? Well, a 15-inch Pro is $2,100.
That sounds great. I'll take it. Great. How would you like to pay for it?
Here's my VISA. Let me ring you up. Okay, sign here, please.
Everything I need is in this box? It'll take her only a few minutes to get online.
Thank you for your help. So long. Thank you for shopping here.
I'm looking for a gift for my daughter. How about a laptop?

Will she need anything besides what's in this box? Everything she needs is right here in the box.
I appreciate your help. Maybe I'll be back for more computer stuff. Your daughter should get straight A's from now on. Good-bye.
I had an appointment tomorrow and I need to change it to a different date. Certainly, what day would be best for you?
I think that Monday or Tuesday would be good for me. I can give you Monday I have ten or eleven in the morning.
I think ten o'clock is best. Fine, I'll put you down for that.
That would be great! Happy I could help you see you then!
I was wondering if I could reschedule my appointment to a later date? OK, just tell me what day would be best for your appointment.

Perfect, I appreciate that. So happy that we had an opening for you.
I can't make my appointment and need to make another one.  That's OK, we can reschedule it if you tell me what day works for you.

Thank you for helping me move. Don't mention it. Where do you want all your furniture?
Okay, I want you to put the sofa in the living room. Would you like me to put it anywhere special?
No, up against the wall is just fine. Where would you like this table?
That table should go in the dining room. Would you like me to put it anywhere in particular?
You can place it right in the center of the room. How are things looking so far?
I think the furniture looks nice in here. You're absolutely right.
I appreciate all your help with this move. It's the least I could do. Tell me where to put your furniture.
That sofa should go in the living room. Was there a certain place you wanted the sofa?

That's the dining-room table of course, silly. Where in the room do you want it?
It would look best in the center of the room. Do you like where everything is so far?
Everything looks great. Yeah, I agree.

George, how is your chicken? My chicken tastes all right, but it is pretty dry. How is your fish?
My fish is pretty dry too. It's almost as if this food has been sitting a little too long. It doesn't seem fresh.
Yes, it seems that way to me also. How are your vegetables?
My vegetables are very soggy. Mine are the same way. It seems like they've been overcooked.
I don't usually complain, but I think that we should mention this to the waiter. I agree. Maybe they can bring us some better food.
George, is your chicken OK? It tastes great, but it is really dry. Is your fish all right?
My fish is very dry. I wonder if they left it sitting around too long before they served it. 
That's exactly what I was thinking had happened. Are your vegetables OK?
The vegetables are kind of mushy. So are mine. I think they left them cooking too long.
The food here is usually good, so I think that we should tell the waiter that there is a problem. I think that you are right. Maybe they can give us a free dessert or something.
Does your chicken taste all right? The chicken tastes wonderful, but it is kind of dry. Is your fish OK?
My fish has good seasoning but is a little dry. It seems as if they got busy and left it sitting before it got to us.
Yes, maybe they are short-handed in the kitchen tonight. Are your vegetables a little mushy?
The vegetables seem to not be very fresh. Mine aren't so good, either.
I usually enjoy the meals here, so I think that we should tell the waiter that there is something wrong with this meal. I think that we should let someone know. They will probably want to fix the problem.
I would like to make an appointment to look at houses. Sure, would you prefer looking in the morning or afternoon?
I would prefer mornings. Can you go during the week, or can you only go during the weekend?
Going to look at houses during the week is best for me. Where would you like me to pick you up?
I will meet you at the real estate office. I am thinking of looking at three houses, and it will take about two hours.
That sounds good to me. Once I contact the owners and confirm the times, I will e-mail you a schedule.
I would like to pick a time to look at houses with you. Would mornings or afternoons be best for you?
It is easier for me to take off work in the afternoon. It is best if we can go during the week does that work for you?
Because of work, I can only go look at houses on the weekend. Would you like to meet at the real estate office, or should I pick you up at home?
If you could pick me up at home, that would be great. We could spend most of the day looking at houses to see all that we have to see.
That might be a little too much, but we'll see how it goes. I will fax you a schedule as soon as I contact the owners to confirm the times.
Can we choose a time to look at houses together? Can you do that in the mornings, or would the afternoons be best?
Either way is good for me. There are a number of open houses this weekend in your area. Would that okay with you?
I can take a little time off work, or I can go on a weekend, also. We could meet at the real estate office, or I could pick you up at your home.
I am leaving from work, so maybe I could just meet you at the first house that we will look at. I can think of five houses that we should look at. It will take most of the day.
I would like to see as many as possible. When I have confirmed the times with the owners, I will e-mail you our plans for the day.

I would love to rent this apartment. I'm happy to hear you say that.
How much are you asking for every month? I'm renting this apartment out for $1050 a month.
That is quite a lot of money for just one month. That is a fair price.
What do you say to $850 a month? That's no good.
It's either $850 or nothing at all. I won't go any lower than $1050.
Could you please go lower? That's the best I can do.
This apartment is wonderful. I'm glad you like it.
How much would I have to pay for rent? The rent is $1050 each month.
That's way too much money. It isn't too much.
How about if I pay $850? I can't take that.
I can't go any higher than $850. I honestly don't know what else to tell you.
You can't go any lower than that? If you can't afford $1050, then we have no deal.
I think I may rent this apartment from you. That's great to hear.
How much are you looking to rent it for? For each month you would have to pay $1050.
That is too expensive. I don't think that is too much for rent.
How does $850 a month sound to you? That's not enough.
That's the best that I can do. $850 a month is not enough money.
Would you please reconsider? That's my final offer. Take it or leave it.
I am calling to find out why I didn't receive an unemployment check this week. Did you send in your Continued Claim Form for the last period?
I think I forgot to send it in! You need to be very careful to send that form in every two weeks if you want to get paid.
Can I send it in now? You should look at your claim form and see if it has been more than fourteen days since it was due. If it hasn't been, we will still accept it.
Can I mail it in early next time so it isn't late? Actually, you cannot mail it in early, as it needs to reflect all of the information up to the due date.
Will my paycheck come right away now? Your check will arrive a little late.
Could you help me figure out why I am missing my unemployment check for this week? I hope that you remembered to send in your last Continued Claim Form.
I am pretty sure that I didn't send that claim form in. You have to send that form in every two weeks so we that we will know what to pay you.
Can I mail it in late? If it is not more than fourteen days past its due date, then you may still mail it in.
I think that I will mail it in right away when I get it next time, so I won't be late. You can't mail it in early because you don't know, in advance, how much you will be working.
Even though I was late turning in my form, will my paycheck be late? Yes, your check will be a little late in getting to you.
I didn't receive an unemployment check this week and need to know why. Did you mail us your last Continued Claim Form?
I am afraid that I forgot to send it in. We cannot pay you unless you turn that form in every two weeks.
Is it too late to mail the Continued Claim Form in now? It can't be more than fourteen days late for us to accept it.
I will mail it in a little early next time to avoid this problem. You can't possibly know in advance how much you will be working. If you mail it in too soon, we will reject it!
Will my paycheck arrive late because I messed up on my form? Your check will be arriving late, but the next one will come right on time.
Is there a medication you can prescribe to help me with my problem? There are various choices of blood pressure medication that we can try.
What is available? We could start with Hydrochlorothiazide, which is a diuretic.
Are there many side effects? There really are not many side effects. You need to drink a lot of water when you take this pill.
Is that the only medication I need to take? It might be, but for a while I also want you to take an ACE inhibitor, Lisinopril.
What are the side effects of that drug? You may have a little bit of a dry cough, but you will feel much better.
Can I get some medicine to help me? For your high blood pressure, we have several choices of medications.

What can I expect when I take that medication? You will feel much better except for the fact that you might have a little cough.
